        You should always test on older browser versions
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 May 2010</span>

    <p>You probably already have installed on your computer various web browsers (FF,
IE, Safari, Opera and Chrome) to test your websites. You most certainly also
have multiple installs of IE (or are using IETester) because the underlying
engine of those browser is very different from one version to another.</p>

<p>Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome users are more educated to the &quot;always
update to latest version&quot; paradygm so you rarely have to debug old and obscure
version of those browsers.</p>

<p>At least it was what I thought until I was stucked with an old 3.0 version of
Firefox on my laptop (mostly due to my inability to upgrade to the latest
version. I&#39;m still new to the linux world and my laptop is running ubuntu).
Anyway, it made me understand that even if you are willing to upgrade you
can&#39;t always do it and old browser versions should be supported too.</p>

<p>In a recent CSS experiment, I managed to style checkboxes and radio buttons in
pure CSS. Unfortunatly, because I was using some &quot;advanced&quot; CSS selectors,
FF3.0 wasn&#39;t able to render it correctly, in fact it was able to render only
half the rules, making the whole thing totally unusable.</p>

<p>That was a perfect example of an old browser I had to debug. I will not dive
into the details of the CSS (mostly because I haven&#39;t fixed it completly), and
this post was only to remind you (and me) to always check on previous browser
versions.</p>

<p>Next post will be explaining how to test on multiple Firefox versions side by
side.</p>

        Using :after and :before
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 May 2010</span>

    <p><code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code>pseudo-elements allow one to add generated content
before or after an other element. It can be used to add quotes around text,
icons after a link to specify the language of the target page and a lot of
other useful stuff like that.</p>

<p>It can also be mastered to create more powerful styling. I&#39;ll post more about
that later.</p>

<p>Anyway, IE6 and IE7 don&#39;t support it. Firefox is supposed to support it from
the 3.0 version but in fact it is still buggy in this release.</p>

<p>Pseudo-elements must be inline elements and can&#39;t be absolutly positionned in
FF3.0, thus greatly reducing the number of fun things we could do with them in
this browser.</p>

<p>It faced me with a challenge. If I wrote <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> rules, they
would be only understood by FF3.0 but badly rendered, resulting in half the
styling I expected.</p>

<p>Browsers that don&#39;t understand the rules would not apply them and keep the
default rendering, compliant browsers will render all the rules, but the grey
area in between is filled with FF3.0 that will think it can handle them and
will finally badly render them.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t found a way to specificaly target FF3.0, so I used an alternate
method.</p>

<p>All the browsers that understand the <code>:only-of-type</code> selector also understand
<code>:before</code>/<code>:after</code>. But FF3.0 and IE7 do not understand <code>:only-of-type</code>. So if
I wrote a rule starting with <code>body:only-of-type</code>, it will only be applied to
browsers with complete <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code>support (excluding FF3.0). This
solved my problem.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, it will also filter out IE7 who does not understand <code>:only-of-
type</code> but does understand <code>:after</code>/<code>:before</code>. I usually remove all fancy form
styling for IE anyway so that&#39;s not a big deal for me, but if you really care,
you just have to override the rule in a IE7 specific stylesheet.</p>

        Running multiple Firefox versions side by side on Windows
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 May 2010</span>

    <p>Whenever you upgrade your Firefox, the new version will overwrite the previous
one. If you want to open multiple Firefox versions side by side, here&#39;s my way
:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, uninstall all your previous Firefox installation(s). Make sure to backup any important data beforehand (I personnaly use MozBackup to do that).</li>
<li>Then install the latest available stable version. This will be the main Firefox version, the one you&#39;ll be using on your dayjob and the one you&#39;ll always update.</li>
<li>Now run the Firefox ProfileManager.
To do that, create a shortcut to your <code>firefox.exe</code> file, then edit this
shortcut. In the &quot;Target&quot; field, add <code>-Profilemanager</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>My field looks like : <code>&quot;C:\Program Files\Internet\Firefox\firefox.exe&quot;
-Profilemanager</code></p>

<ul>
<li>You now have to create one new profile for each FF version you plan on testing. Give them meaningful names. I named mine &quot;FF3.0&quot;.</li>
<li>Now download the corresponding Firefox version from <a href="http://www.oldversion.com/Mozilla-Firefox.html">oldversion.com</a></li>
<li>Do not install it, but extract its content (using a archiving tool like winrar or 7-zip) in a tmp directory. Remove the <code>optional</code>directory as well as <code>removed-files.log</code> and <code>setup.exe</code>.</li>
<li>Copy the content of <code>localized/</code> into <code>nonlocalized/</code> (overwrite files if asked).</li>
<li><p>You can now rename the <code>nonlocalized/</code> directory and move it around on your hard drive.
I renamed mine to <code>Firefox 3.0/</code> and put it alongside the main Firefox, in
<code>C:\Program Files\Internet\Firefox 3.0\</code></p></li>
<li><p>Create a shortcut to the <code>firefox.exe</code> file in this directory and edit the target field.
This time, we have to specify which profile to use. Just add <code>-P &quot;FF3.0&quot; -no-
remote</code> in the target field.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Mine now looks like <code>C:\Program Files\Internet\Firefox 3.0\firefox.exe&quot; -P
&quot;FF3.0&quot; -no-remote</code></p>

<p>That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Now, just run your classic Firefox shortcut to open the most up to date
Firefox version, and use the custom shortcuts to open previous versions.</p>

<p>I personnaly also rename the different <code>firefox.exe</code> to <code>firefox30.exe</code>, or
<code>firefox35.exe</code> to more easily spot them in the taskmanager.</p>

<p>I also edit each <code>.exe</code> with ResHack to change their taskbar icons. I haven&#39;t
yet managed to change their title.</p>

<p>Edit : Now I can&#39;t open .html files directly from the explorer nor follow
links from my IM. I still don&#39;t know exactly what of the steps above caused
that.</p>

        Changing Firefox language

    <span class="post-date">04 May 2010</span>

    <p>I&#39;m French, live in France, but usually prefer having my software in English.</p>

<p>This is so because english words are generally shorter (and thus fits more
easily in a GUI) and most of the time french translations aren&#39;t optimal.</p>

<p>I just download the latest Firefox version from their website, and without
knowing it, it was a French localized one. They do some sniffing on the user
agent string and automatically download the corresponding file.</p>

<p>That seems a great idea, but I prefer my software in english, so I searched
for a <code>en-US.xpi</code> file to update firefox. It does exists for any other
language, but not for <code>en-US</code>, this being the default language, as stated in
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=485860">this bug report</a>.</p>

<p>It seems the only way to have an english Firefox is to download the english
version, there is no way to change it afterwards.</p>

<p>You can type <code>about:config</code> and change the <code>general.useragent.locale</code> value to
<code>en-US</code> but it does not update the main language, only tell plugins to use
that language (AFAIK).</p>

<p>Changing the language in the options only change the user agent string.</p>

<p>Well, I had to backup my profiles, uninstall FF, download the english version
and reinstall it.</p>

    <p>Imagine the following HTML code :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;wrapper&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
[... various HTML elements ...]
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;bar&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>bar<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>foo<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;bar&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>bar<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;foo&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>foo<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>How would one style the first <code>div.foo</code> ?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried <code>div.wrapper div.foo:first-of-type</code> but unfortunatly it does not
work. In fact the previous rule can be translated into &quot;select the first child
of div.wrapper only if it is a div.foo&quot; and not &quot;select the first div.foo
inside div.wrapper&quot; as I imagined.</p>

<p>Using jQuery I could do a <code>$(&#39;div.wrapper div.foo:first&#39;)</code> but there&#39;s no such
selector in CSS.</p>
