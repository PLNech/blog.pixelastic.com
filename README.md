This repository holds all the content of my personal blog. 

## Jekyll and Hyde

It is build using the static website generator Jekyll and the Hyde theme, by
@mdo.

## Previous versions

This is the third iteration of my blog. I kept the content but updated both the
theme and the underlying technology. Version 2 was based on cakePHP, but
I decided to try the static generation adventure, hoping it will help me blog
more often.

## GitHub

As an exercice, I also made the code available on GitHub. Using git makes
backups a non-issue, and site updates are only a `git push` away. As most of my
workflow now involves `git`, it seems a natural evolution.

## Todo

- Maybe convert back all html to real markdown
- Escape html in post titles.
- Add syntax highlighting to all code snippets
- Allow browsing per year, and set default folder pages
- Import all images from previous blogposts
- Find a favicon
- Add tags to link posts together
- Enable search (google search ?)
- Add link to the RSS
- Integrate comments ? I'd like a comment API to be linked in javascript.
- Try a different default font
- Put some 304 redirects on the old website to point to the new url. Generate
  a 304 to redirect ids to new urls.
