# blog.pixelastic.com

This repository holds all the content of my personal blog. 

## Jekyll and Hyde

It is build using the static website generator Jekyll and the Hyde theme, by
@mdo.

## Previous versions

This is the third iteration of my blog. I kept the content but updated both the
theme and the underlying technology. Version 2 was based on cakePHP, but
I decided to try the static generation adventure, hoping it will help me blog
more often.

## GitHub

As an exercice, I also made the code available on GitHub. Using git makes
backups a non-issue, and site updates are only a `git push` away. As most of my
workflow now involves `git`, it seems a natural evolution.
