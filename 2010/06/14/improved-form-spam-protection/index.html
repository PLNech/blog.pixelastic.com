  <h1 class="post-title">Improved form spam protection</h1>
  <span class="post-date">14 Jun 2010</span>
  <p>My spam protection is really simple. Most spam bots will fill all input fields
they&#39;ll find in a form. If one is named website or email, they will most
certainly want to fill them first.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve added to every form a fake input field with a <code>name=&quot;email&quot;</code>that have
to stay empty. I also labeled it &quot;Spam bait&quot; and displayed a little sentence
to tell my human readers to keep this field empty.</p>

<p>I also hide the whole field using Javascript because most of the bots don&#39;t
have Javascript enabled, but legitimate users do.</p>

<h2>Does it work ?</h2>

<p>To say the truth I don&#39;t know. In the previous version of this website I
haven&#39;t any kind of spam protection and was receinving almost a dozen spam
mails a day.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve added this protection, I don&#39;t receive spam anymore. But that
doesn&#39;t mean my protection is working, it may just mean that the spam bots
needs a little time to adjust to the new website.</p>

<h2>Improving the existing</h2>

<p>One week ago, two spam comments managed to get past my protection. I have
currently no way to judge my protection efficiency. Maybe that was the only
two spam comments aimed at my website and I let them both slip in. Maybe I was
under a mass attack and managed to block thousand of spam and those two were
the only two to beat me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I have absolutly no numbers on that.</p>

<h2>Getting some stats</h2>

<p>So today, I decided to add some extra measures. I&#39;m keeping count of every
spam I block (this number will be displayed below the comment list if at least
one spam was blocked).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll also log some informations when someone is posting a comment : headers
sent, if javascript is enabled and the delay between displaying the form and
submitting it.</p>

<p>It is useless to build protection if you don&#39;t know what you want to be
protected against. So I&#39;ll let the actual protection in place and will come
back to check the numbers in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll then know exactly how performs my existing spam protection and will be
able to extract spam patterns from the information I&#39;ll gather.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ll add a timing system, to block comments that were posted too fast.
If nothing works I&#39;ll use Akismet, but I want to try to defeat them on my own
first.</p>
