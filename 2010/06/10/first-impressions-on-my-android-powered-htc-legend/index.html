  <h1 class="post-title">First impressions on my Android powered HTC Legend</h1>
  <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2010</span>
  <p>I recently bought an HTC Legend. My old phone was broken and I have plans to
develop an Android app. I&#39;ve been using the phone for 3 weeks now, and I&#39;m not
exactly as thrilled about it as I think I would.</p>

<h2>Open source from Big Brother</h2>

<p>I was hoping to have a little piece of open source software in my pocket. In
fact, it turns out that Google has a little more piece of me when I&#39;m using
the phone.</p>

<p>The software is not that open. Maybe it&#39;s because of my phone carrier, SFR,
but there are a lot of pre-installed and useless apps that I can&#39;t get rid of.</p>

<p>Some settings can&#39;t even be changed because I&#39;m only a user of my own phone
and don&#39;t have a root access by default. The &quot;Accessibility&quot; setting panel is
a joke (I&#39;ll post a picture of it later)</p>

<p>When I first switched the phone on, I was asked for my Google credentials.
Once entered, all my Google life was downloaded to the phone : mail address
book, google maps location and google calendar meetings. Asking first if I
wanted that would have been great.</p>

<p>Because loading 500+ mails address book into a phone memory is not the kind of
&quot;smart&quot; I was expecting from a smart phone. I had to manually remove all the
contacts I needed not from my phone.</p>

<p>And then the phone was complaining again, when it tried to synchronize back
with Gmail, when it tried to remove the mails from my online address book.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want them downloaded in the first place and once I removed them I
didn&#39;t want them to be deleted from my online address book !</p>

<h2>Disabling sync</h2>

<p>So I tried to remove the google account from my phone, but that is clearly
impossible and is NEEDED to make the phone work. What ? This is stupid.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not confortable with having a device from which I can&#39;t even remove my
credentials... At least I disabled the auto-sync feeature.</p>

<p>An other thing to note is that if you want to fine-tune what kind of data your
phone syncs, you first have to enable the auto-sync feature and quickly
disable the data you don&#39;t want, because they all are checked by default.</p>

<h2>Other settings</h2>

<p>Even changing the default ringtone is a chore. There&#39;s no way to easily select
a music file saved on the SD card. There isn&#39;t even a native file explorer,
you have to download one from the Market.</p>

<p>The camera quality isn&#39;t very good and the auto-focus makes pictures more
blurry with it than without. Even my old Nokia XpressMusic was taking better
shots.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I really am disapointed by this phone actually, and by the Android platform as
a whole. Maybe the underlying app is great but as an end-user we are blocked
from it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to root my device and remove the SFR rom to get what I want and need.</p>
