  <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2010</span>
  <p>Today I had to update an old site I developped some years ago. I had to move
it from one host to another and make sure all the configuration followed.</p>

<p>It scares me. What I wrote 3 years ago scares me. My code was... well there
was some huge mistakes, things I would never ever do again. Today, I would
severly frown upon any coder who wrote horribles things like that.</p>

<p>For the php part, here is a very good list of what NOT to do :</p>

<ul>
<li>I used shorthand notation for my php tags : <code>&lt;?</code> instead of <code>&lt;?php</code>.</li>
<li>My server was set as <code>register_global</code> off, but I was circumventing it by doing my own <code>register_global</code> on :</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">extract($_SERVER);</span>
<span class="x">extract($_COOKIE);</span>
<span class="x">extract($_GET);</span>
<span class="x">extract($_POST);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>My files were encoded in Latin-1, my database was in <code>latin1_swedish_ci</code> and my html head was set to <code>iso-8859-1</code>. At least, that was consistent.</li>
<li>I wasn&#39;t EVER testing if my variables were set, so I had notices popping everywhere. I had the error_reporting set to disable them, hiding the error instead of writing better code.</li>
<li>The password of my users were stored UNCRYPTED in the database... And stored uncrypted in the cookie as well.</li>
<li>I was doing something that was supposed to be OOP, but I never used heritage, so all my classes were containing the same methods, copied and pasted from one file to another, and changing only some variable names...</li>
</ul>

<p>And some other mistakes :</p>

<ul>
<li>I included a whole bunch of Javascript files (like 15 or so) and was NOT using any js framework. Well, technically I was using a js framework, but one I developped. And let be honest, I can&#39;t really call it a framework today.</li>
<li>I used <code>letter-spacing:-1000em</code> to hide text (when using an image as a header for example). It broke on Firefox, I&#39;m now using <code>text-indent:-1000em;</code> (really, I don&#39;t know if this is better).</li>
<li>There was a flash animation with sound, enabled by default and with auto-play. For my defense, I remember having told by ex boss that it was a bad idea but he insisted.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be honest a part of me is horrified of what I wrote some years ago and
thought was great. On the other hand, I&#39;m quite proud of the progress I have
made in so little time.</p>
