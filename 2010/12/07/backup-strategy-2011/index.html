  <h1 class="post-title">My new backup strategy for 2011</h1>
  <span class="post-date">07 Dec 2010</span>
  <p>My computer was starting to get slower and slower for the past days. And I
realized my automatic backup wasn&#39;t backing anything up for the past month.</p>

<p>And I realized I had different versions of the same files on my 2 laptops...</p>

<p>Well, it seems I have to do some cleaning up.</p>

<h2>Synchronizing paperwork</h2>

<p>I started by cleaning up my <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox </a>folder. I
removed shared folders with past clients, and created a &quot;Paperwork&quot; folder
where I put all my invoices, contracts and general paperwork.</p>

<p>I also added my private <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass </a>file as well as other
info I may need to access anywhere, anytime.</p>

<p>KeePass allow me to store all my login/password credentials in a secure way
(protected by a master password). It is really useful to have this file on all
my computers (and mobile phone).</p>

<p>Dropbox is excellent for storing simple files, that you need everywhere. Being
able to access invoices and contracts even from my mobile phone proved quite
valuable when meeting clients.</p>

<h2>Hard backup of personal files</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve also changed my scheduled backups of personal files. I bought an <a href="http://www.acronis.com/">Acronis
True Image</a> last year, and reconfigured it today.</p>

<p>I have a hard drive whose sole purpose is to save backups. I scheduled for the
first of each month to save : my system state, my applications configuration,
and my personal files (photos, saved gamed, writings, etc).</p>

<p>I manually started all this backups to have a clean start. I also forced the
backup to restart a whole new file every 6 month (opposed to using the
incremental backup).</p>

<h2>Backing up my music and movies</h2>

<p>I did not spent too much time figuring how to save my hundred of Go of music
and movies. I rarely watch the same movies twice, so losing them won&#39;t affect
me too much.</p>

<p>I occasionally re-watch series, though, but as most of my friends have the
same tastes as I, I could very easily get them back from them, or download
them (again).</p>

<p>Regarding music, well, I have quite a big collection, but most of it is
already &quot;backed up&quot; on my portable mp3 player.</p>

<h2>Automatic synchronizing with BitBucket</h2>

<p>On my day work, I now always version my files using Mercurial.
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> offers unlimited storage, and unlimited
public repositories. Private repo are limited to 5 users. As I&#39;m mostly alone
on projects that should stay private, this seems the best deal I could found.</p>

<p>Mercurial being a versionning system, I got all the benefits of a backup here,
being able to revert to previous versions, update it whenever I want and
access it from anywhere.</p>

<p>I wrote a custom Hg hook on commit to automatically push my repos to BitBucket
at least once a day (I&#39;ll post the code in a future post).</p>

<h2>MySQL Backup</h2>

<p>I used to backup mysql databases on my work computer using a windows app. This
was slowing down my computer on every boot as well and backup was thus only
effective when I was working and not when I was on vacations.</p>

<p>Today, I wanted something a lot more flexible, so I set a cronjob on my main
host coupled with a slightly edited <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup/">autoMySQLBackup
</a>script.</p>

<p>This will automatically run everyday at midnight and make a local save (with
daily, weekly and monthly rotate) of all my clients databases. Logs are saved
on disk and gzipped, and will also be sent to a special backup@pixelastic.com
mail address (stored on GMail).</p>

<p>This way I am sure to have my mysql backups on two different hosts, with daily
and automatic saves, that I can access from anywhere if anything goes wrong.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It took me almost two full days to get the right tools, configure them and
write my custom scripts but now, it is seamlessly integrated with my daily
workflow. This is a weight off my shoulders, I know I can safely work as usual
and my files are saved and easily accessible.</p>
