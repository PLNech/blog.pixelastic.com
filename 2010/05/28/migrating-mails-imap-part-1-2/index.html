  <h1 class="post-title">Migrating mails from IMAP to IMAP (part 1/2)</h1>
  <span class="post-date">28 May 2010</span>
  <p>One of my clients wanted to change its hosting provider because of almost
constant downtime. I suggested that we move the whole site and the associated
email addresses to Dreamhost.</p>

<p>He is heavily using its webmail, with a dozen of different accounts, all with
custom address book and drafts to reuse.</p>

<p>I had already moved a previous site of the same client to a GMail powered
webmail and he wasn&#39;t so satisfied of it because of the lack of a &quot;draft&quot;
feature that would allow him to reuse the same message templates.</p>

<p>Its current webmail is powered by Imp (Horde) and the default Dreamhost
webmail is Squirel Mail.</p>

<p>So now I&#39;m faced with a challenge. Which webmail should I choose and how will
I initiate the migration ?</p>

<h2>Contestant 1 : Horde</h2>

<p>The easiest way would have been to reuse Horde. Horde has a nifty
export/import function. It means that I could have exported the settings on
the current host and imported them back in the new host.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, Horde is not pre-installed on Dreamhost. It means I would have
to install it and I don&#39;t really want to do it. This is not my area of
expertise and if something goes wrong it will take me ages to fix.</p>

<p>Additionnaly, the default php5 install on Dreamhost lacks the IMAP extension
needed and SSL connection requires an additional monthly fee.</p>

<p>That would be the better solution for the client, but I don&#39;t feel capable of
doing it.</p>

<h2>Contestant 2 : Squirel Mail</h2>

<p>Squirel Mail is the default webmail on Dreamhost. It means that they do handle
all the heavy stuff of configuring it and making sure it does not crash.</p>

<p>They assure me that I can have unlimited hosting of my mails, the only limits
are a maximum of 100 SMTP sending per hour and no attached filed &gt; 7Mo.</p>

<p>Those are almost no issues at all, we can handle that. I just have to check if
the 100 sending per hour is for each mail address or for the entire account.</p>

<p>The only problem will be that I can&#39;t export/import the horde feature into
Squirel.</p>

<p>What I could do however is synchronize the two IMAP servers, effectively
copying all the mail from the current one to the new. Unfortunatly, there is
no easy way to do that.</p>

<p>The Dreamhost support even told me that it was impossible. I found a linux
command named imapsynch however that maybe could help, but I&#39;ll need to know
the name of the dreamhost imap server and needed credentials to connect to it.
I&#39;ll sort this out with them.</p>

<h2>Contestant 3 : GMail</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve already set mails up with GMail a couple of times in the past so this
won&#39;t be too hard. Could take some times, but nothing difficult about that.</p>

<p>I may be able to copy the current mails to the GMail server, I&#39;ve seen some
articles on the subject floating on the network, but I&#39;ll definitly won&#39;t be
able to copy drafts.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&#39;m still in contact with the Dreamhost support to choose the better option. I
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll install Horde, this will be too much work. I guess I&#39;ll go
with the second option of migrating mails to Squirel Mail.</p>

<p>Whatever solution I&#39;ll pick, I&#39;ll be sure to post the whole details here for
others to follow.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p><del>I finally won&#39;t have to migrate mails, the client makes regular POP
backup of its mails so he will just do one more right before the transfer and
will start over with a brand new mail boxes. Concerning the drafts, he will
manually copy-paste them from one webmail to the other and he told me that he
wasn&#39;t using the address book...</del></p>

<p><del>So it appears that I&#39;ll just have to change the DNS to point to the new
webmail and create a temporary CNAME to still access the old webmail on the
old server until the migration is totally over.</del></p>

<p>Re-update</p>

<p>In fact, it appears that I won&#39;t be able to access both webmail at the same
time. I&#39;ll have DNS issues, and the registrar panel that I have is very basic,
I won&#39;t be able to fine tuned it correctly.</p>

<p>It seems that I&#39;ll have to migrate mails from one server to the other.</p>
