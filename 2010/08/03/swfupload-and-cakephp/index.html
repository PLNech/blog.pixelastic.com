  <p>One thing that always sent me an awful hours of debugging is the fact that the
Flash player identify itself as a whole different browser that the one it is
integrated into.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve ran into this issue multiple times when dealing with SWFUpload and today
was one more. As I always spent quite a lot of time debugging issues arising
from this, I guess I should post about it here.</p>

<h2>The Flash player uses a different userAgent that your browser</h2>

<p>Most of the time, this is not a problem. But when dealing with restricted
areas of a website built on top of cakePHP, it can become one.</p>

<p>The thing is that as the <code>userAgent</code>string used by the Flash player is not
the same as the one used by your browser. So, when you make a request to your
site, cake will see that as whole new request and you won&#39;t be able to access
your current session variables.</p>

<p>As you can&#39;t overwrite the <code>userAgent</code>hash sent, you need to send the
<code>sessionId</code>along with your flash request. That way, you&#39;ll be able to call a</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">$this-&gt;Session-&gt;id($sessionId);</span>
<span class="x">$this-&gt;Session-&gt;start();</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>in your controller <code>beforeFilter</code>(or component <code>initialize</code>)</p>

<p><em>In cake 1.2, you&#39;ll also have to call <code>$this-&gt;Session-&gt;destroy()</code> before to
delete the Flash session created.</em></p>

<h2>The Flash player uses a different cookie pool that your browser</h2>

<p><em>This used to be an issue in 1.2 but not longer is.</em></p>

<p>Cake stores in a cookie the name of the session you&#39;re supposed to use. Flash
having its own cookie pool, it will save its own cookie (usually somewhere you
don&#39;t even know) and will always check for the session specified inside.</p>

<p>This took me quite a long time to found out why the flash request where
reading an other request that the one I was setting.</p>

<p>In 1.2, you needed to delete the cookie created by cake whenever you made a
flash request to avoid conflicts</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">setcookie(Configure::read(&#39;Session.cookie&#39;), &#39;&#39;, time() - 42000, $this-&gt;Session-&gt;path);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>cakePHP used to overwrite the userAgent string in session</h2>

<p>In cake 1.2, when you manually change the current session, cake would update
the inner <code>userAgent</code>hash saved to your current userAgent hash.</p>

<p>This meant that whenever you were moving from the Flash session to the correct
session, you had to overwrite the <code>userAgent</code>hash to the correct one.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">$this-&gt;Session-&gt;write(&#39;Config.userAgent&#39;, $userAgent);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>This is no longer the case in 1.3, changing the current session does not
alter it anymore.</em></p>

<h2>Doesn&#39;t all that stuff alter security ?</h2>

<p>Well, most of the answers I found online were among the lines of &quot;Just disable
the check of the <code>userAgent</code>&quot;, so I think my method is a little bit more
secure.</p>

<p>Anyway, passing a <code>sessionId</code>as a parameter seems a little risky, even to me.
I guess there should be a way of encrypting it to not pass it as clear text</p>

<h2>UPDATE !</h2>

<p>I had to fiddle with this script some more. It appears that, as we are
changing the <code>sessionId</code>, we need to do that BEFORE we access the session. It
means that any call to <code>Session::read()</code> or <code>Session::check()</code>, or almost any
other Session method BEFORE setting the id will block this trick from working.
So, make sure that this code is executed before anything else, put it in a
component that will be loaded first.</p>

<p>It also appears that if you follow my advice, you&#39;ll only have to call
<code>id($sessionId)</code>, and none of the hocum pocum about <code>destroy</code>, <code>write</code>and
<code>userAgent</code>hashes I talked about...</p>

<p>I just lost some hours finding this out. I add a call to Session in my <code>I18n
</code>component that was rendering this whole fix useless. It was driving me
crazy...</p>
