  <h1 class="post-title">Using nested subrepos with Mercurial and TortoiseHg</h1>
  <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2010</span>
  <p>Nowadays, when I&#39;m developping a new website, I almost always ended using
parts and bits of the previous website I&#39;ve done. All my websites are based on
the same framework (cakePHP) that I have itself updated with its own CMS
(Caracole, more on that later).</p>

<p>Caracole is made of several little plugins, each one of them focusing on a
simple task (like handling 404 errors, adding a recycle bin, draftable
elements, SEO-friendly url, and so on).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also updated each one of this plugins to BitBucket, allowing me to easily
commit changes and clone new version from one project to another.</p>

<p>But very often, when working on a specific project, using a specific plugin I
think that I can update the plugin (be it either by adding a new feature or
fixing a bug I&#39;ve discovered). In that case, I want my changes to be added to
both the plugin (on BitBucket) and the project I&#39;m working on at the moment.</p>

<p>To do that, I had to struggle my way with Mercurial because nested
repositories (called subrepos) is not a trivial setup.</p>

<h2>Setting up subrepo with Mercurial :</h2>

<p>Let me show you the classical and easy way to achieve that :</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s say you have your main repo. You go in the directory where you
want to add your subrepo and you either create it using hg init or hg clone.</p>

<p>You then go back to your main repo root and edit the .hgsub file (if you don&#39;t
have this file yet, just create it). Add the following line to the .hgsub :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span class="na">path/to/your/subrepo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">path/to/your/subrepo</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, on every subsequent commit Hg will be aware that your repo is holding a
new subrepo. If you omit this line, Hg will not allow you to commit
complaining about a repo inside an other repo.</p>

<p>You can now safely commit your main repo, or your subrepo independently.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s see the edge case.</p>

<h2>Changing a classical sub directory into a subrepo</h2>

<p>The classical example above is what you can find in the Mercurial help pages.
It wasn&#39;t that helpful for me because my setup was a little different and it
was causing Hg a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>I was not creating a new subrepo, nor cloning a new one. I had sub diretcory
of my main app, that I wanted to change into a subrepo. My sub directory was
named &#39;myplugin&#39; and I had a repo of that name hosted on BitBucket.</p>

<p>So I tried to delete my existing &#39;myplugin&#39; directory, and clone the
&#39;myplugin&#39; from BitBucket, edit the .hgsub and commit but Hg aborted the
operation, complaining about the repo in repo file structure.</p>

<p>After a lot of testing, and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2371330/what-is-the-correct-way-to-%0Ahandle-nested-hg-repositories-with-mercurial-tortoiseh">cry for
help</a>, I finally managed to
get it to work. The workflow is almost the same, with one little new step.</p>

<p>Deleting the &#39;myplugin&#39; folder wasn&#39;t enough. I had to tell Mercurial to
completly remove this files from its index. Using TortoiseHg, I was able to do
that by right clicking on the folder, and then choosing &#39;TortoiseHg &gt; Remove
Files&#39;. Then I had to commit those changes, officially telling Mercurial to
forget this files, and putting it in a state where those files aren&#39;t there at
all.</p>

<p>Then only was I able to clone my repo from BitBucket, edit the .hgsub file and
commit my main repo.</p>
