        Web and dev events in Paris
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>For the past month or so, I&#39;ve attended quite a bunch of dev and web events,
here in Paris.</p>

<p>Every time I get back from one, I wanted to post something about it. But I
never did, as I always seems to have something more important to do. That&#39;s
quite a shame, because those events were (for the most part) really
interesting, some were even really motivating.</p>

<p>So, expect a full blog post on each of them in the coming days. For the time
being, here is just an overview.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paris-web.fr/">Paris Web</a> is THE french web event. Two days of
conferences about the web, not too technical, but very practical. Here we
speak equally about the &quot;why&quot; than about the &quot;how&quot;. Very great speakers, team
and place. The third day is for workshops, in smaller groups.</p>

<p>Then comes <a href="http://parisjs.org/">Paris JS</a>, held each month. It&#39;s an evening
of informal talks about Javascript, a few speakers will demo an app, a
framework, or talk about anything JS related. Very great to meet interesting
JS fellows, and exchange about frameworks and projects.</p>

<p><a href="http://parishackers.org/">Paris Hacker</a> is an other informal event, where
everyone is free to speak about any hacky/geeky subject. Most of the time we
review the last Hacker news posts and discuss them, talk about incoming
events, and so on. There almost no trolling. Most of the time.</p>

<p><a href="http://js-attitude.fr/js-guru/">JsGuru</a> is a completly different kind of
event. This one is a one-day Javascript formation. It costs real money this
time, but you got to learn a few tricks and get your started on some
frameworks and libraries like Backbone, Mustache, Lawnchair, etc.</p>

<p>And the final one is the <a href="http://hackdayparis.org/">Hack Day Paris</a>. Partially
organized by the same team as Paris Hacker, it was a 40hrs hackathon, with no
constraint except to &quot;build something brilliant&quot;. More than 180 fellow geeks
attended, and 43 projects were finally demoed on stage. This was one of the
most motivating experience I ever did.</p>

<p>A few days after the Hack Day, an other event was held by SFR were all the
Hack Day participants were invited. Along with participant from two other
events (Designer Weekend and Museomix), the goal was to help all those people
to meet, and to showcase some of SFR latest innovation. This is clearly the
event that I liked less.</p>

        Paris Web 2011 : Accessibility
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>In October, I was attending the Paris Web event. For those that haven&#39;t heard
of it, it is THE french web event, two days of conference on various subjects
web related. It is language agnostic and talks range a very broad list of
topics from accessibility, open data, security, performance, UX, UI, html5,
etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve attended 16 talks in the course of the event, plus a full day of
workshops. I would need far more than a single post to write down everything I
learn from those days, both technical and human. I really love Paris Web for
those moments where you start to chat with other peoples as passionate as you
are.</p>

<p>Here, I&#39;ll only focus on a specific subject that everyone cared about :
Accessibility.</p>

<h2>Know your audience</h2>

<p>Accessibility was discussed at length, as it always is the case in Paris Web.
It is one of the values held by Paris Web that I also hold dear. My only
regret is that it feels like everyone in Paris Web attendee were already
familiar with it, had implemented at least the basic good practices, that we
all were already convinced of why it is good. I kind of feel that were not the
right public, that the speech was wasted on us as we already were convinced.</p>

<p>We, as web professional, are aware of the accessibility concerns. Big groups
and public websites are aware of it too. But the middle ground of small
companies do not care. &quot;This is not our target&quot;, &quot;Spending 40% more for 10% of
users ? No way&quot;, &quot;We are not big enough&quot;, are answers I&#39;ve often heard when
trying to explain to clients why I cared about aspects of their projects they
didn&#39;t even see.</p>

<h2>Continuous integration</h2>

<p>Laurent Denis and Elie Sloèª°m told us that accessibility should not be thought
as the last part of a project, the one we do the day before launch. It has to
be taken into account for the very start of the project, in the conception
phase, and not at the end, as a correction phase.</p>

<p>Every person ever included in the project should be at least aware of the
accessibility concern, this is not the work of one man alone. Accessibility
experts are not people you can hire to fix your website once it&#39;s done. They
should be requestd during all the conception phase.</p>

<p>No one ever read the 100 page accessibility audit. No one wants to be told at
the end of the project that what they did is wrong and that they should start
everything over from scratch. Instead, mini briefs, on mini subjects,
sometimes no longer than 15mn, on a regular basis can yield very great
results. Starting with the general website semantic, adding unobstrusive
javascript, and going deeper and deeper into tasks more and more difficult.</p>

<p>There is no perfection in accessibility. There&#39;s only an ideal we tend to. You
don&#39;t fix a website for accessibility, you just improve it.</p>

<h2>Throw away formal accreditations</h2>

<p>We can&#39;t make a website absolutly perfect, we can just improve it on little
touches to make it better and better. A, AA and AAA homologation is absurd,
because there is no metrics to quantify the level of accessibility of a
website. How could you compare two accessibility features ? How video
subtitles is more accessible than alt on images ? We should just forget the
accreditations. At first, we did accessibility improvement to help people with
disabilities. Somewhere along the years, we became legally forced to provide
accessibility measures and it became one more line on the planning and we lost
the initial meaning that was driving us.</p>

<p>We should really take accessibility down that pedestal we put it. It&#39;s not
that hard to make an accessible website, don&#39;t be scared by the list of
accreditation and rules.</p>

<h2>What about HTML5 ?</h2>

<p>The geek side of your mind can&#39;t stop feeling the excitation when everyone
talks about all the shiny stuff : file API, history, geolocation, web sockets,
forms, etc. But the eternal question remains : what good are those new toys if
we can only serve them to a handful of users. Will I use them now, for the
benefit of only some, or will I wait for better support for the benefit of all
? But if I don&#39;t promote them myself, I&#39;m only slowing down adoption by all
browsers...</p>

<p>That&#39;s a tricky question and I don&#39;t have a definite answer (and that&#39;s fine
!).</p>

<p>Paul Bakaus posted recently and article where he stated that it is better to
build something awesome for 70% of the people that something good for 95% of
them. It surely is true in the gaming world where gamers have the habit of
buying new hardware to keep with the new game graphics. In the classical web
world, we are still scared of asking the user to change its browser.</p>

<p>But it tickles my accessibility sense when someone told me that a part of the
users won&#39;t be able to access the content because they don&#39;t have the correct
requirement. This feels absolutly contrary to the open web principles.</p>

        Getting list of Facebook friends from a test account
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>To get the list of friends of a specific user, you are supposed to issue a
simple <code>GET</code>request to <code>me/friends</code> (or <code>USER_ID/friends</code>), passing the user
accessToken in the request.</p>

<p>Facebook used to return an array named <code>data</code> where each value is an object
representing a friend. Each of this objects had two keys : <code>id</code>and <code>name</code>.</p>

<p>Until yesterday, it worked well.</p>

<p>Today, it seems broken for test users. The <code>name</code>key is no longer returned in
the call, you only get <code>id</code>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s intentionnal or not. At least I haven&#39;t seen any notice
about this change. But I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a bug either, as Facebook
documentation is crappy, we never really know if the output we got is the
expected one or if it&#39;s a bug.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure we were supposed to get the <code>name</code>in the first place,
actually.</p>

<p>What is definitely a bug is that the behavior is different for test users that
for classic users.</p>

        Passing flashVars with Flash 10 in IE
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Oct 2011</span>

    <p>I&#39;ve spent the last two days debugging a weird issue involving https, IE and
Flash.</p>

<p>In the end, I boiled the issue down to IE and Flash 10, https wasn&#39;t involved
(in fact, that was a different issue).</p>

<h2>Markup hell</h2>

<p>It is known that to have a real crossbrowser markup to embed Flash we need an
IE specific version and a non-IE one.</p>

<p>What I didn&#39;t know was that <code>flashvars</code>needed to be passed in two different
formats between Flash player 10 and Flash player 11.</p>

<p>11 expect the classic <code>flashvars</code>parameter while 10 expect them to be passed
as simili GET parameters to the movie url.</p>

<h2>Final HTML markup</h2>

<p>In the end, here is the PHP code I use to generate my SWF markup :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">sprintf(</span>
<span class="x">  &#39;&lt;object classid=&quot;clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000&quot; width=&quot;%1$s&quot; height=&quot;%2$s&quot; id=&quot;%3$s&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="x">    &lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;%4$s?%6$s&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="x">    %5$s</span>
<span class="x">    &lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;--&gt;</span>
<span class="x">      &lt;object type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; data=&quot;%4$s&quot; width=&quot;%1$s&quot; height=&quot;%2$s&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="x">      %5$s</span>
<span class="x">    &lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;</span>
<span class="x">    %7$s</span>
<span class="x">    &lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;--&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;</span>
<span class="x">  &lt;/object&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&#39;,</span>
<span class="x">$width, $height, $id, $url, $params, $flashVars, $alternateContent);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Where :</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$width</code> and <code>$height</code> are the size (in pixel) of your movie</li>
<li><code>$id</code> is the html/css id of the main object element (as used in <code>swfObject.getObjectById</code>)</li>
<li><code>$url</code> is the url address of your swf file</li>
<li><code>$params</code> is a string containing all the <code>&lt;param name=&quot;name&quot; value=&quot;value&quot; /&gt;</code> that you want to pass. Usually it will contain the <code>wmode</code>, <code>allowfullscreen</code>, <code>allowscriptaccess</code>and <code>flashvars</code>keys.</li>
<li><code>$flashVars</code> is a duplicate of the <code>flashVars</code>key of <code>$params</code> and should contain a string in the form <code>foo=bar&amp;baz=nyan</code> to be passed to the swf in Flash 10</li>
<li><code>$alternateContent</code> is the html text to be displayed when Flash is not installed in the browse</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that this markup will help you, because I spent a damn long time
testing all that stuff, jungling between VM and IE instances.</p>

         swfobject.getObjectById() when flash not installed
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2011</span>

    <p>SWFObject is the de-facto library used whenever you need to ember Flash files
in your code. It takes care of smoothing all cross browser issues.</p>

<p>It has a <code>getFlashPlayerVersion</code>method that return a string of the current
version in the form <code>major.minor.release</code>. Its value is <code>0.0.0</code> if Flash isn&#39;t
installed.</p>

<p>It also provides a cross browser markup, including conditionnal comments for
IE, that validate and works everywhere. The downside is that it forces you to
create two elements in your markup with the same id.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the <code>getObjectById</code>method is here to return the correct DOM
element based on the browser flash integration type.</p>

<p>But... It seems that the mechanisme is buggy when Flash isn&#39;t installed (on
2.2)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tested running IE9 without Flash installed and FF8 with Flash disabled,
and the return of <code>getObjectById</code>differs : I got <code>null</code>in IE9 and the DOM
element in FF8.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve added a small patch to my code to take it into account :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">el</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">swfobject</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getObjectById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And I&#39;ve also submitted a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/issu%0Aes/detail?id=599&amp;thanks=599&amp;ts=1319792868">bug report</a>.</p>
