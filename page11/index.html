        Working on Wednesday #10 : Mercurial improved
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Aug 2011</span>

    <p>Today I enjoyed the nice blue sky and moved to the park at the end of my
street to finish reading the Mercurial guide.</p>

<p>I skipped the last chapters about patches and queues. I know this would be
useful, but I&#39;d rather get back to them when I&#39;ll need them instead of try
them without any real world example.</p>

<h2>Tweaking Mercurial</h2>

<p>I updated my <code>.hgrc</code> to configure it as best as I could.</p>

<p>I set <code>vimdiff</code> to handle the conflicted merge. <code>vim</code> is quite hard to get
(but it is coming easier the more you use it), but it seems so powerful that
I&#39;m willing to spend some time learning it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also added a <code>cm</code> alias to <code>commit -Am</code>. This basically is the same as
calling <code>hg addremove; hg commit</code> which I happen to do all the time before.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve create two simple styles and matching templates for my new two aliases
<code>peek</code> and <code>hist</code> that repectively display a peek at the last 4 commits, and
display the latest 10 commits in history in a concise way. I still have to
manage to find how I could add coloring to those.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also added a <code>discardlocal</code> alias to remove all local commit and get the
repo back as it is on the remote repo. I never actually had to use it, but I
found the code on Stack Overflow and thought I might need it later.</p>

<p>I finally wrote a custom <code>resurect</code> method. It will bring back a deleted file
(obviously, the file needs to be tracked by hg). I simply find the changeset
that deleted the file, and then revert the file to the parent changeset of
that changeset. I might post the exact code later as I&#39;m quite happy with the
result.</p>

<h2>A note on laptop screens</h2>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve spent the last few weeks working on my netbook when at home. This
is very tiny thing, the screen is really small (compared to my two 21&quot; at work
for example). But (and I was the first surprised of it), you actually get
accustomed to it after a while.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m writing this post on my 13&quot; other laptop, I feel like it&#39;s huge.
The more I use the netbook, the more I like it. I didn&#39;t quite use it back
when it was running Windows because it was way too slow. Now with Ubuntu on
it, it&#39;s a whole new story !</p>

<h2>Next week</h2>

<p>I still have some zsh to learn. I still don&#39;t quite get the quote and double
quote differences, and a few other quirks (arithmetic, arrays, etc).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve kinda dropped the Rails tutorial. I liked it. Really, I liked it a lot.
But I&#39;m not sure I want to start again learning a framework for making
websites. I&#39;ve made a living doing websites for clients, I still do partly
that today, and I&#39;d like to change.</p>

<p>I have a lot of personnal project on my mind that I&#39;d like to achieve. Almost
all of them could be achieved using the traditional way of making websites
that both cake and Rails would allow. But one of them might need another way
to look at things. And for this one, I might better need node.</p>

<p>So.. maybe I&#39;ll start learning node next week. This is actually something I&#39;d
love to do, so this might happen. I&#39;m currently refactoring the JS code of my
work app in Backbone at the moment, so I guess there&#39;s no perfect time for
some JS practice.</p>

        Working on Wednesday #9 : Mercurial
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2011</span>

    <p><em>I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m getting more and more behind schedule for what I
intended to do at first. I still haven&#39;t tried Rails more than that and have
gone on different learning side projects.</em></p>

<p>_I&#39;ve been reading the _<a href="http://hgbook.red-%0Abean.com/read/">Mercurial : Definite Guide</a> the past few days to get a correct grasp of the soft.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been using Mercurial for the pas two years, but through a GUI and without
using any &quot;advanced&quot; features. I never branched a project, and always worked
alone.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>Now that I&#39;m working on a Linux machine every day, I can use hg through the
command line.</p>

<p><code>hg commit -Am &quot;commit message&quot;</code> is the same as <code>hg addremove; hg commit -m
&quot;commit message&quot;.</code></p>

<p><code>hg rollback</code> will remove the last local commit. Useful if you forgot files in
the commit, or if you inserted a typo in your commit message</p>

<p><code>hg revert</code> can revert a file or set of files to the state they were at the
last commit. This can also cancel a <code>hg add</code> or <code>hg remove</code></p>

<p><code>hg backout</code> can &quot;forget&quot; a commit in the history. It will not really forget
the commit (ie. will not let you alter the history). Instead, it will create a
new commit where the specified changeset is removed (through a merge). It can
easily backout the tip, but may involve more merge work if we want to backout
an old changeset.</p>

<h2>Automation</h2>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve learned about two great tools of Mercurial.</p>

<p><code>hg bisect</code> let you isolate a specified commit in your history where you
introduced a specific bug. You write a piece of code that, given a changeset,
returnsÂ <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> based on the bug presence, and <code>hg bisect</code> will
cleverly scan the history to find the revision that introduced the bug.</p>

<p>hooks where also very interesting. One can script automatic command on
specific hg command like <code>commit</code>, <code>pull</code>, <code>push</code>. Or even before those
commande to refuse the command if something does not work as expected.</p>

<p>The classical examples where running a build process after a commit, refusing
a commit if no bug id where specified, or if the tests didn&#39;t pass. Another
use case would be to push changes to a remote server on commit.</p>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p>Why am I learning Mercurial while all the cool guys are using git ?</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;ve read a lot of papers comparing hg to git. What I&#39;ve read the more
is that git is an awesome toolbox that lets you do whatever you want with your
version control, through its 100+ tools.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mercurial is far easier to learn and has built-in command
for the day to day work. As I was already quite familiar with Mercurial, I
stick with it, but know that I&#39;ll learn git also eventually.</p>

        Creating a readonly mysql user
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2011</span>

    <p>I wanted to give access to a database to a colleague, so he can connect and
extract some useful stats from our database.</p>

<p>As I didn&#39;t want to give him nor the root, nor my access nor even an access
with writing permission to avoid potential issues, I created a readonly user.</p>

<p>First, connect to the mysql server :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">mysql --user<span class="o">=</span>root -p
</code></pre></div>
<p>And type your password when asked</p>

<p>Now that you are in the mysql prompt, create the &#39;readonly&#39; user and give him
<code>SELECT</code>permission on all tables</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">USER</span> <span class="s1">&#39;readonly&#39;</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="s1">&#39;%&#39;</span> <span class="n">IDENTIFIED</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="s1">&#39;your_password&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">GRANT</span> <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">TO</span> <span class="s1">&#39;readonly&#39;</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="s1">&#39;%&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Also note that once connected with root, you can see the list of users by
running :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="k">host</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">user</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">pass</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">mysql</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="k">user</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Nothing fancy here, everything was found after a few minutes of googling.</p>

<p>Also, if you ever need to delete the user :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="k">DROP</span> <span class="k">USER</span> <span class="s1">&#39;readonly&#39;</span><span class="o">@</span><span class="s1">&#39;%&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

        Working on Wednesday #8 : Custom zsh scripts for housekeeping
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2011</span>

    <p>I made a break of the Ruby/Rails learning this week. Instead I learned a bit
more about the basic Linux command, and made a few scripts to help me in my
day to day work (and fun) with my Linux environment.</p>

<p>I currently use two laptops. One is a tiny netbook while the other a Dell XPS.
I mostly use the XPS for everything work related (like posting this), while
the netbook is dedicated to casual use : browsing, playing, etc.</p>

<p>Last week, during my vacations, I only took the netbook with me, and while not
strictly speaking working on it I still had to code a little bit. I installed
<code>ScummVM</code>, <code>CortixTH</code> and managed to run Carmageddon 2 under <code>wine</code>. I also
downloaded and tried a few old emulator games on my
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingoo_A320">Dingoo</a>.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed, I wrote a bunch of scripts during that week to help
me in some of the more tedious aspects of this task.</p>

<h2>Dingoo deployment</h2>

<p>Downloading roms, copying them to the Dingoo, and then testing the games to
make sure they are working was tedious. I wrote a little script that
automatically mount the Dingoo when plugged to the computer, and copy my games
to it, removing old version along the way while still keeping my saved games.</p>

<p>I had to parse <code>dmesg</code> (thanks to <code>grep</code>, <code>tail</code> and <code>sed</code>) as well as use
<code>rsync</code> for the copy.</p>

<h2>Sansa Clip cleaning</h2>

<p>I also wrote a simple script to clean my <a href="http://anythingbutipod.com/2009/08/sandisk-sansa-clip-plus-review/">Sansa
Clip</a> of
all the useless files I had put on it. As I only have a text screen, I don&#39;t
need the <code>jpg</code> covers, torrent <code>txt</code> files, auto-generated <code>m3u</code> files and
other <code>thumbs.db</code> and <code>.DS_Store</code> useless files.</p>

<p>Here, <code>find</code> to the rescue with some <code>zsh</code> scripting, and here we go.</p>

<h2>Shared config files</h2>

<p>As I&#39;m working on several computers (two laptops and the one at work at
least), I found myself spending time reconfiguring stuff multiple times.</p>

<p>Here, thanks to Dropbox and some clever <code>ln -s</code> calls, I managed to replicate
the same config on the 3 machines easily.</p>

<p>From my freelance time, I also have a pretty big <code>/etc/hosts</code> and
<code>~/.ssh/config</code> file. At work, I have another one for the work servers. But I
sometimes had to connect to the work server from home.</p>

<p>So once again, thanks to Dropbox, some <code>ln -s</code> once more and <code>cat</code> I wrote two
functions to regenerate those two files based on config files. That way,
whenever I change one of those files, it is updated on the other machines too.</p>

<p>That was it. It took most of my day.</p>

<p>Being able to script those little repetitive tedious task is something I
really appreciate on Linux. I am no longer dependent on the UI my OS gave me,
and can now really understand how things work. It requires some time to learn,
but this is not going to drastically change from one version to another like
it does on each Windows new release.</p>

        Working on Wednesday #6-#7 : Correctly installing Ruby on Rails
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2011</span>

    <p><em>This post spans two weeks because I couldn&#39;t manage to have a clean
Ruby/Rails install on my first try. I read a lot, installed ruby using various
methods, but finally managed to get it to work corretly.</em></p>

<h2>Cleaning up</h2>

<p>First of all, you have to remove any ruby version you might have already
installed, just to be sure.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">sudo apt-get remove ruby <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> sudo apt-get autoremove
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Installing RVM</h2>

<p>Then, you have to install RVM before installing Ruby. My biggest mistake in my
various shots at installing Ruby was to install RVM last.</p>

<p>RVM is a very important part of the whole Ruby process. This is a little piece
of genius that allow you to create Ruby sandboxes. You can install various
Ruby versions side by side, even various gem versions and you simply tell RVM
which sandbox you want to use.</p>

<p>If you are absolutly positive that you will never ever work on more than one
Ruby project in your entire life, you can skip installing RVM and simply
install Ruby globally on your system. But you know that this will never
happen, so, avoid future troubles and install RVM first.</p>

<p>To install RVM, simply execute the following command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">bash &lt; &lt;<span class="o">(</span>curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will download and execute the install script. Once it&#39;s finished, edit
your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code> to include the rvm config file whenever a shell is
launched.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="o">[[</span> -r <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.rvm/scripts/rvm <span class="o">]]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">source</span> <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.rvm/scripts/rvm
</code></pre></div>
<p>Just to sure to have the latest version, I also ran</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rvm get head
rvm reload
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Updating your system</h2>

<p>RVM depends on some binaries to work, so be sure to install them all. They are
listed when running <code>rvm notes</code>, but as the time of writing this was the list
for me :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">sudo apt-get install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Installing Ruby</h2>

<p>Once RVM is installed, installing the latest (1.9.2 as the time of writing)
Ruby version is as easy as :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rvm install 1.9.2
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will take some time, downloading and compiling Ruby. Next, tell RVM that
this is the version we are gonna use.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rvm use 1.9.2
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can always switch back to your system-wide ruby install by doing</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rvm use system
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Creating a gemset</h2>

<p>Plugins in Ruby world are named gems. They can easily be installed/uninstalled
to a project to provide advanced features. Rails itself is a gem.</p>

<p>The traditional way of using gem is to simpy using the RubyGem command <code>gem.</code></p>

<p>When using RVM and its sandboxed mode however, the best way is to create a
gemset, and install gems in that gemset. This will allow us in the future to
switch between multiple gemset easily.</p>

<p>I suggest creating a gemset for each project you start. You can also install
gems in the global gemset so they get available to each project. As I&#39;m new to
the Ruby world and still don&#39;t really know which gems ar &quot;must-have&quot;, I&#39;ll
skip this part for now.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s create a new gemset for our new project. I&#39;ll name mine <code>pixelastic</code>,
but change the name to fit your project name</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rvm gemset create pixelastic
rvm gemset use pixelasticÂ 
</code></pre></div>
<p>You&#39;ll be now using the gemset <code>pixelastic</code>. You can list all available gems
in your current gemset by doing</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">gem list
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or list all the available gemsets by doing :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rvm gemset list
</code></pre></div>
<p>The one you are currently using will be prefixed by <code>=&gt;</code></p>

<h2>What is Rake ?</h2>

<p>You might have noticed that your new gemset contains only one gem, named Rake.
You do not need too spend to much time on that. You simply have to know that
Rake is more or less the Ruby compiler. Your Ruby code will go through this
gem to became a running app.</p>

<h2>Installing Rails</h2>

<p>As I said above, Rails is a gem like many other, so you can simply install it
by doing :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">gem install rails
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that because we are using RVM, the gem will only be installed in this
gemset and not globally. If you switch gemset, rails will no longer be
available.</p>

<p>If we weren&#39;t using RVM, the gem would have been installed globally. RVM is
actually wrapping itself around the <code>gem</code> command to sandbox it inside its own
gemset.</p>

<h2>Handling dependencies with Bundler</h2>

<p>Installing Rails will install a bunch of other gems. One of them is Bundler.</p>

<p>Bundler is a Rails specific gem dependencies handler. Its features seems to
overlap thoses of RVM. At the time of writing, I haven&#39;t yet used it, but its
main use still seems to be its gemfile.</p>

<p>The goal of a gemfile (located in your project directory) is to list all the
gems your project will need (along with respective versions if provided).
Then, whenever you drop your project in a new environment, Bundler will be
able to download and install your gems for you.</p>

<p>If said environment uses RVM, then the gems will be saved in the gemset, if
not they will be installed globally. Bundler is absolutly not linked to RVM
and can be used independently.</p>

<p>The syntax of a gem file will not be discussed here as I have no previous
experience with them, but the command to read the gemfile and update the
project accordingly is :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">bundle install
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Automatic switching gemset</h2>

<p>One nice bit of RVM is that it is able to automatically detect the gemset to
use on a per project basis. You simply have to create a .rvmrc file in a
project, and RVM will execute it.</p>

<p>For example, to use my <code>pixelastic</code> gemset and Ruby 1.9.2, simply add the
following to your <code>.rvmrc</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">rvm use 1.9.2@pixelastic
</code></pre></div>
