        MySQL Error 1577 on Dreamhost
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2010</span>

    <p>Recently, when connecting to my MySQL databases on Dreamhost through Navicat,
I was greeted with a &quot;<code>1577 - Cannot proceed because system tables used by
Event Scheduler were found damaged at server start</code>&quot; error message.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t stop me from accessing the tables actually, so I didn&#39;t bother. But
today it prevent me from copying tables from one server to another, so I
decided to have a deeper look into it.</p>

<p>It seems that it has to do with a mysql upgrade issue. I contacted Dreamhost
about that and they told me that they just upgraded their servers to 5.1, and
that they needed to be restarted. Which they do for me.</p>

<p>So if you ever run into the same problem, just contact Dreamhost support and
they&#39;ll fix it for you.</p>

        First impressions on my Android powered HTC Legend
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2010</span>

    <p>I recently bought an HTC Legend. My old phone was broken and I have plans to
develop an Android app. I&#39;ve been using the phone for 3 weeks now, and I&#39;m not
exactly as thrilled about it as I think I would.</p>

<h2>Open source from Big Brother</h2>

<p>I was hoping to have a little piece of open source software in my pocket. In
fact, it turns out that Google has a little more piece of me when I&#39;m using
the phone.</p>

<p>The software is not that open. Maybe it&#39;s because of my phone carrier, SFR,
but there are a lot of pre-installed and useless apps that I can&#39;t get rid of.</p>

<p>Some settings can&#39;t even be changed because I&#39;m only a user of my own phone
and don&#39;t have a root access by default. The &quot;Accessibility&quot; setting panel is
a joke (I&#39;ll post a picture of it later)</p>

<p>When I first switched the phone on, I was asked for my Google credentials.
Once entered, all my Google life was downloaded to the phone : mail address
book, google maps location and google calendar meetings. Asking first if I
wanted that would have been great.</p>

<p>Because loading 500+ mails address book into a phone memory is not the kind of
&quot;smart&quot; I was expecting from a smart phone. I had to manually remove all the
contacts I needed not from my phone.</p>

<p>And then the phone was complaining again, when it tried to synchronize back
with Gmail, when it tried to remove the mails from my online address book.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want them downloaded in the first place and once I removed them I
didn&#39;t want them to be deleted from my online address book !</p>

<h2>Disabling sync</h2>

<p>So I tried to remove the google account from my phone, but that is clearly
impossible and is NEEDED to make the phone work. What ? This is stupid.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not confortable with having a device from which I can&#39;t even remove my
credentials... At least I disabled the auto-sync feeature.</p>

<p>An other thing to note is that if you want to fine-tune what kind of data your
phone syncs, you first have to enable the auto-sync feature and quickly
disable the data you don&#39;t want, because they all are checked by default.</p>

<h2>Other settings</h2>

<p>Even changing the default ringtone is a chore. There&#39;s no way to easily select
a music file saved on the SD card. There isn&#39;t even a native file explorer,
you have to download one from the Market.</p>

<p>The camera quality isn&#39;t very good and the auto-focus makes pictures more
blurry with it than without. Even my old Nokia XpressMusic was taking better
shots.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I really am disapointed by this phone actually, and by the Android platform as
a whole. Maybe the underlying app is great but as an end-user we are blocked
from it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to root my device and remove the SFR rom to get what I want and need.</p>

        Arsys, a registrar to avoid
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2010</span>

    <p>When I use great registrars or hosting services, I say so, and loudly. From
all those that I have tested, there is no better registrar than Gandi and no
better hosting service than Dreamhost.</p>

<p>But when I encounter really lousy services, I won&#39;t hide to say so too.</p>

<p>Arsys is one of them. It&#39;s a franco-german-spanish registrar. I just needed to
change the DNS server of a domain on it, and even that was impossible.</p>

<p>When I tried to put Dreamhost NS servers in the form and submit it, I was
greeted with a bold red error message telling me that an error occured and
asking me to try again later.</p>

<p>I did try again later, just to receive the exact same error message.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have to leave Arsys default NS servers if at least they allowed me
to configure A, CNAME and MX records as I wanted but unfortunatly, none of
this is available.</p>

<p>I tried to contact their support service, to tell them my problem, but here
again I was faced with an error message on a blank page (in spanish this time)
telling me that the server encountered a problem and that I needed to contact
an administrator (sic)</p>

<p>So I tried to find a contact page on their public site, and after some 404
errors finally found an email address.</p>

<p>I send them a email telling them about my problems. They answer stating that
if I have any problem, I should use their contact form to contact
hostmaster@arsys.fr. I tried, and this time it worked.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been 4 days, and I haven&#39;t heard from them yet. In the meantime, I choose
to quit this registrar and moved the domain to Gandi.</p>

<p>What is the most strange is that when you google them you got lot of praises
about their wonderful customer service... After having tested it, I just don&#39;t
buy it.</p>

        Migrating mails from IMAP to IMAP (part 2/2)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2010</span>

    <p>I&#39;ll finally have to migrate mails from one IMAP server to another because of
a change in the hosting provider of one of my clients.</p>

<p>Let me first do a quick review of my current config :</p>

<p>I have an IMAP server on a not-so-reliable host. I need to move all the
mailboxes to a brand new Dreamhost server.</p>

<p>The current host use horde/imp as its webmail, but Dreamhost is running under
Squirel Mail.</p>

<h2>How to do that ?</h2>

<p>When I first contacted Dreamhost to ask them the better way to copy the
content of my old IMAP server to their new one, they told me that IMAP to IMAP
transfer was unfortunatly not possible.</p>

<p>After some digging I found a little linux tool called <code>imapsync</code>that was
developped to synchronize two IMAP servers. As I only wanted to copy content
from one server to an empty one, I guess it should work.</p>

<p>And it does.</p>

<h2>Installing the tool</h2>

<p>First of all, you really need to have a Linux machine. I&#39;m sorry for all
Windows and Mac users out there, but this solution will only work with Linux.</p>

<p>Obviously, you&#39;ll first have to download and install it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a newbie linux user, and don&#39;t use it at its full potential. It means that
I rely a lot on the UI, I don&#39;t know most of the more basics commands.</p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t know the correct procedure to install something, I always use the
Synaptic Packager Manager UI. I just have to type <code>imapsync</code>, check its
checkbox and start the install.</p>

<p>I guess you, more experienced linux user, would know how to do that anyway.</p>

<h2>Running the command</h2>

<p>Once it&#39;s installed, you&#39;ll just have to run one command. But before typing
it, you have make sure that you have all the required informations.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll need the server name, login and pass of both the source and destination
account.</p>

<p>In my case I had previously reset all the password to newly generated one on
the source server, then created the same email (with same password) on the
destination server.</p>

<p>For the source server name, you shouldn&#39;t have any problem finding it. It
usually is something like <code>mail.domain.co</code>m.</p>

<p>But for the destination server, that&#39;s a little more tricky. As I haven&#39;t yet
changed DNS, I have a Dreamhost server but no domain name pointing to it. So I
can&#39;t use <code>mail.domain.com</code> there.</p>

<p>I had to go my Dreamhost DNS panel (clicking on DNS under the name of my
domain in Manage domain) and check for the IP address associated with the
<code>mail A</code> entry.</p>

<p>Once you have all this, create a file (name it <code>pass</code>) which contain the
password of your account (or <code>pass1</code>and <code>pass2</code>if source and destination
password aren&#39;t the same). This is done so you won&#39;t type in clear text the
password of your accounts, or they could be found in the history files.</p>

<p>Once it&#39;s done, just run the following command</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">imapsync --host1 mail.domain.com --user1 contact@domain.com --passfile1 /path/to/pass1 --host2 208.97.XXX.XXX --user2 contact@domain.com --passfile2 /path/to/pass2 --noauthmd5
</code></pre></div>
<p>It is not an instant process, actually in can be quite long. One of the
mailbox I had to move had more than 20.000 mails in the sent folder and about
40.000 in the received one. It took me almost 18h to complete.</p>

        Overview of the different ways of protecting your email address
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Jun 2010</span>

    <p>You surely know that displaying an email address as plain text in a website
today is a sure way to get your mailbox full of viagra, rolex and poker ads in
no time.</p>

<p>Spammer have bots running all day long, crawling through hundred of thousands
of pages, grabbing everything that looks like something@somewhere.com.</p>

<h2>Existing way of protecting your email address</h2>

<p>The safest way is to not display it in the first place. Nothing beats that.
But if you really need to be contacted through email, here are some of the
possible alternative.</p>

<h2>Using a contact form instead.</h2>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing on this site.</p>

<p>This way I don&#39;t have to display my address, I let my server script send the
email for me.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, it means that you have to protect your contact form against spam
now. How to do that is not the scope of this post, however.</p>

<h2>Using an image</h2>

<p>Instead of writing your email as plain text, you can use an image inside which
your email is written. Spam bots can&#39;t read images (well, they <strong>could</strong> but
they won&#39;t bother when there is still so many clear email they can grab
without worrying about images).</p>

<p>Unfortunatly it has two drawbacks. First, you force your reader to type your
email as they can&#39;t copy/paste it. This lead to possible typos, and more
importantly will frustrate your user.</p>

<p>Secondly, people browsing without images (yes, that does exists, either
because they have a slow connection, browsing through an old mobile phone or
using a text reader) won&#39;t be able to contact you.</p>

<h2>Spelling it aloud</h2>

<p>One of the better way is still to appeal to the human brain and telling your
user what your email is, like &quot;my name, at, my domain dot com&quot; or
&quot;tim@nowhere.com where you have to change nowhere to pixelastic&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve even seen someone using the very long form of : &quot;tee ee em at pee hi ex
ee el ah ess tee hi see dot see oh em&quot;. Sure, spammer won&#39;t get that, but the
truth is, not many user won&#39;t either.</p>

<p>The drawback of this method is the same as the previous one, you force your
user to type your address.</p>

<h2>Ain&#39;t there an easiest way ?</h2>

<p>Would&#39;nt it be better if we hadn&#39;t to worry about that. If there was a way
that all our reader would read the email, click on it and send us a mail ?
While being protected from spam bots ?</p>

<p>Well, there have been attempt to do that, using various server side and client
side techniques. Unfortunatly, all of them failed for at least one type of
users.</p>

<h2>Encrypting email using unicode</h2>

<p>One can encrypt any string in Unicode using server script language. It will
turn every character into an entity like &#46;. Your browser will stil
understand it correctly, and display it as the corresponding value.</p>

<p>We could assume that bots won&#39;t understand it, but I have no data to back that
up. It would be trivial for an harvest bot to parse email using unicode, so I
won&#39;t recommend it.</p>

<h2>Using CSS to display the mail</h2>

<p>Modern browser, with great CSS support can help in this process with the use
of generated content and the :after pseudo class.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the following code :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;email&quot;</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;@pixelastic.com&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>tim<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">span</span><span class="nc">.email</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">rel</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="nd">:after</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">content</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">rel</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You just put your username in the <code>span</code>, and the domain name in the <code>rel
</code>attribute and let CSS display it as one single email address.</p>

<p>But you need a browser with a correct CSS support to do that, otherwise you
will only see the user part, which is not really useful.</p>

<h2>Using an HTTP redirect</h2>

<p>This one is a clever one that I haven&#39;t seen used a lot. Instead of making a
link to a mailto:, you make the link go to a mail.php page that will only
contain one php statement :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">header(&#39;Location: mailto:user@domain.com&#39;);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I&#39;m not sure of the browser support of this, however. And it still won&#39;t solve
the problem of displaying your email address.</p>

<h2>Adding HTML noise</h2>

<p>You can add HTML comments (<code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>), or useless elements (<code>&lt;span /&gt;</code>) all
around your email adress. They won&#39;t get processed by your browser that will
still display it as normal, but it will most likely make the spam bot choke.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, you can&#39;t use them in the <code>href=&quot;mailto:&quot;</code> section of your link,
so it is not a perfect fit either. But still, that&#39;s a good start.</p>

<h2>Using Javascript to populate the email</h2>

<p>The principle behind this one is that Javascript will write the email adress
for you in the code. As most spam bots won&#39;t have Javascript enabled (again, I
don&#39;t have source to back that up but I assume so), they won&#39;t be able to see
it.</p>

<p>Just write your email address in a Javascript file, maybe in several different
variables that you&#39;ll merge to create the final one. The more obfuscated your
code is, the harder it will be for the spammer to add its logic to its bot.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There isn&#39;t one perfect solution yet. But maybe, merging several of them we
could bypass the weaknesses to create something that really handle all the
situations.</p>

<p>I have some ideas in the back of my head actually, I&#39;ll try to make something
with them and post it here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure starting with an obfuscated HTML source (but still correctlt
displaying), then adding an obfuscated Javascript layer to create the
<code>mailto:</code> link is the way to go.</p>

<p>This would mean a better user experience for users with Javascript, but that&#39;s
ok, that&#39;s what Javascript is for.</p>
