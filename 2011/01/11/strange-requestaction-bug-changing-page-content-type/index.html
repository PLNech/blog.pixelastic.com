  <span class="post-date">11 Jan 2011</span>
  <p>Today, I thought my current project was finished. But I had this bug report in
my tracker from one of the beta-tester telling me that one of the page wasn&#39;t
rendered properly.</p>

<p>It says that the code source was displayed on screen instead of being rendered
as HTML. And only on Firefox.</p>

<p>And if that wasn&#39;t odd enough, even with the plethora of Firefox versions I
got, I couldn&#39;t reproduce the bug on my side.</p>

<h2>Turning off the debugger to debug</h2>

<p>Then I had an idea. I turned off the debug mode, and was then able to
reproduce the infamous bug.</p>

<p>As I initially supposed, there was something wrong with the <code>Content-Type</code>
header. The Firebug Net Panel told me that it was set as <code>text/plain</code> while
the developer toolbar insisted that it was <code>text/html</code>.</p>

<p>After some digging in my own code, I found the culprit. A <code>requestAction()</code>
call I made as part of an update process. This <code>requestAction</code>was targeted at
a <code>.txt</code> file.</p>

<p>I played a little with the debug value and found that for any value above 2,
everything was working correctly, but if I set my value below that threshold,
my whole view will get displayed as <code>text/plain</code>.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t quite explain why a debug value will have anything to with the view
rendering. I even disabled the Debug Kit component, just to be sure.</p>

<h2>Digging into cake world</h2>

<p>And then I decided to follow the dispatch trace to find where the debug value
was being used. After a long journey, I got to the <code>respondAs</code>method of the
<code>RequestHandler</code>component.</p>

<p>And specifically, to that part :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">if (Configure::read() &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; !defined(&#39;CAKEPHP_SHELL&#39;)) {</span>
<span class="x">  $this-&gt;_header($header);</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, so there was my debug value. Exactly the code reponsible for my symptoms.
Well, I still don&#39;t understand WHY someone wanted to add an header based on
the debug value, but I could easily understand HOW it made my view that ugly.</p>

<p>The <code>requestAction</code>was being dispatched all along the way to its final
action, firing the <code>RequestHandler</code>component on its way. Its extension being
<code>.txt</code>, <code>RequestHandler</code>will fire its <code>respondAs</code> method and set the
appropriate header.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, setting such an header in a <code>requestAction</code>wasn&#39;t useful for
the request, and additionnaly, it was messing with the primary view dispatch
path.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I<a href="http://cakephp.lighthouseapp.com/projects/42648-cakephp/tickets/1445%0A-requestaction-may-change-the-current-layout-depending-on-debug-value"> reported the
bug</a> hoping
for a fix in a future version. For the time being, I manually set the debug to
2 before calling my <code>requestAction</code>, and set it back to its previous value
after in my app.</p>

<p>And for why it was only buggy on Firefox, it was caused by a double header
definition. A first header was telling <code>text/plain</code> and a second one<code>
text/html</code>. I guess Firefox uses the first one while other browsers the last.
This is what made Firebug and the Developer Toolbar return different results
too.</p>
