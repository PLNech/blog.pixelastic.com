  <span class="post-date">25 May 2011</span>
  <p>Starting June 15th, I&#39;ll stop working at my day job for one day a week.
Instead, I&#39;ll use this time to work on personal projects.</p>

<p>After more than 3 years of freelancing, I&#39;ve been working full time for a very
nice young company (making a great social game) for the past 6 months. Today,
with the public release of the game, I find myself missing freelance.</p>

<p>I liked being able to sleep when too tired, working late at night when really
productive, reading a log of blog posts on various subjects, learning new cool
stuff other did. I kinda miss that on my new job.</p>

<p>Sure our project is damn cool and I really like working on it. I learn a lot,
in fields that I was interested in but never had the chance to explore (server
administration, CDN configuration, memcache, large number of users, etc).</p>

<p>But on the other hand, I&#39;m almost only doing server-side work. I relatively
interesting part of Javascript (nothing fancy) and a really small part of CSS.</p>

<p>And I miss all that front-end part of the job. I also get kind of tired of
using cakePHP. I do like it a lot, but the more I write PHP and read posts
about Ruby, the more I want to switch.</p>

<h2>Working 4 days a week</h2>

<p>I finally made a deal with my boss, for not working on Wednesday. I want to
use that time to relax and learn all those things.</p>

<p>The last time I was working full time for a company, I finally quit because I
thought I was waaaaaaay late behind all the current tech trends. It took me a
couple of month to learn the cool stuff I&#39;m armed with today : jQuery and
cakePHP.</p>

<p>This time, I want to re-learn a whole new world, a better one. Using all I
learnt those past years to make a fresh start.</p>

<h2>What I want to learn</h2>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of things I would love to learn, unordered :</p>

<ul>
<li><code>vim</code> : I want to be able to write code on any machine, easily, and fast</li>
<li><code>ruby</code> / <code>rails</code> : I want to learn Ruby to be able to fully understand Rails. I have a pretty strong knowledge of cakePHP so I guess Rails won&#39;t be too hard for me.</li>
<li><code>git</code> : I like Mercurial, but <code>git</code> seems to be the de-facto VCS for all the social geeks and rails coder, so why not ?</li>
<li><code>sass</code> and <code>haml</code> : Those seems awesome, and were part of the things that make me want to try ruby. Writing CSS and HTML in a non-painful way. I already want to write modules (or are they called gems?) to enhance them, adding webperf optimisations on the fly (creating sprites/dataURI, optimizing selectors, etc).</li>
<li>CoffeeScript, Kafeeine or equivalent : Following the logic behind sass, I want to be able to write Javascript easily. I always encounter issues when my jQuery code became too big, everything gets tangled together. Backbone.js seems interesting too. I&#39;ll have to test all those solution.</li>
<li><code>nodejs</code> : Because it looks kinda fun. I haven&#39;t really understand how it works yet, but it looks fun anyway :)</li>
<li>TDD : This is not a technology, but a way of writing code that I want to learn. I tried it in cakePHP, but I spent so much time writing tests (and making them work), to finally change the implementation and broke the tests that I finally gave up. I still have to understand HOW to do it properly. I thought I read somewhere that this principle was directly intergrated into Ruby (or was it Rails ?) development.</li>
</ul>

<p>To summarize, I want to learn the good tools that will let me focus on the
project(s) I want to make, not fighting to use tools to bend them to my needs.
Writing &quot;uncompiled&quot; css, html or Javascript and having some automation tool
to automatically transform it in the most usable version to use only.</p>

<p>Also, I have already written a pretty decent cakePHP CMS, with a full featured
admin panel that I used when making website for clients. I wanted to put it
open source for all to enjoy but never really knew how to do it. I don&#39;t yet
know if I want to create a whole new CMS in Rails, or if I&#39;ll do custom dev
for each project, or use (and enhancing) existing CMS.</p>

<h2>That&#39;s all for now</h2>

<p>I might have forgotten stuff (I&#39;d want to try couchDB/mongoDB, getting better
at using Linux everyday), but here is a dump of all the things I want to
achieve in the next 6 month, one day per week. I&#39;ll try to post a summary of
what I learned each Wednesday, hoping that it would help others (I know I&#39;ll
surely enjoy looking back at it later).</p>
