<p>On July 21st will be held an <a title="Performance meeting" href="https://sites.google.com/a/survol.fr/webperf-user-group/evenements/21-juillet-2010">informal meeting in Paris</a> for all the web developers that have an interest in web performance.</p>
<p><a title="Eric Daspet blog on web performance" href="http://performance.survol.fr/" target="_blank">Eric Daspet</a> and <a title="Stoyan Stefanov dev blog" href="http://www.phpied.com/" target="_blank">Stoyan Stefanov</a> will be there and host a talk about performance impact on sales and some more technical less known facts.</p>
<p>The first part will be in French while Stoyan's will be in English. If you have the chance to be in Paris in July, do not miss this event.</p>
<p>I will, of course, be there. Eric Daspet is the french "gourou" on web performances, and Stoyan Stefanov is one of the main author of the Smushit plugin/websit.</p>
<p>Web performance is a really interesting subject where there is so much to learn and so much to try.</p>
