<p>As you may have heard, Yahoo! is closing <a title="Delicious" href="http://www.delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a>. I had started to use Delicious a lot lately, to work as a decentralised save of all my bookmarks and being able to search through them easily.</p>
<p>In my recent attempt to save as much of my work online, losing Delicious would meant losing a large part of collective wisdom. So I search for an alternative.</p>
<p>I finally registered for <a title="Pinboard" href="http://pinboard.in/" target="_blank">Pinboard </a>a few days ago. It allows an easy way to import Delicious bookmarks in a matter of seconds and has all the features of Delicious I wanted.</p>
<p>It is not free however, but the one-time fee depends on the number of people using the service. I payed mine 9.12$.</p>
<p>The website itself is not as good looking as Delicious (*ahem*), but it does provide a cleaner search experience (in my point of view). I really don't care about other people bookmark, I only search through mine.</p>
