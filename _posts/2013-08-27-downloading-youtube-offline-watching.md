<p>Call me old fashioned but I do not really like the "always connected" motto that the industry is following right now. I like to have physical music and video files on my hard drive, so I can access them anywhere, anytime, without relying on me being connected to a network.</p>
<p>And yes, I get the irony of talking about <em>physical </em>files<em>.</em></p>
<p>Anyway, I now download movies directly from <a href="http://youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/">Dailymotion</a>, <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> and consorts, copy them to my smartphone, and watch them in the train, waiting queues or bed.</p>
<p>To achieve that, here are the command-line tools I'm using. First is <a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a>, and as its name does not imply at all, it can download from more than Youtube. The second one is <a href="https://github.com/bf4/vimeo_downloader">vimeo_downloader</a> which is specialised in downloading from Vimeo. And the last one is the more generic <a href="http://code.google.com/p/get-flash-videos/">get_flash_videos</a> that can download from a variety of smaller websites.</p>
<p>All those scripts accepts the video url as parameter.</p>
<p>Happy scripting and happy viewing !</p>
