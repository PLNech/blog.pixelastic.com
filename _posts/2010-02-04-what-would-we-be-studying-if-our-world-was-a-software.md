<blockquote>
<p>Physics is just reverse-engineering the world</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I once heard or read that somewhere and that make me smile.</p>
<p>Today I wondered if the same analogy could be applied to the other subjects we are teached in school.</p>
<p>If Physics is reverse-engineering, then Mathematics is using the World framework and developping new applications and unit testing with it.</p>
<p>Biology would be micro-debugging and desassambling it, maybe even re-compiling it.</p>
<p>History would be nothing more than writing and parsing the logs.</p>
<p>Geography would be mapping the whole network.</p>
<p>French (or English, or whatever your first language is) would be reading and learning the doc and man pages. And of course, foreign languages would mean learning new programming languages.</p>
<p>Sports would be the fun part, where you are playing you video games.</p>
<p>Did I forgot something ?</p>
