<p>I often hear how Ruby is better than PHP, that cakePHP is only a port of the Ruby on Rail framework and that the original is much more powerful.</p>
<p>Well, I've been tempted to try and learn Ruby for some quite time now. But I've been a little scared by the fact of having to learn a whole new language when I'm now getting pretty good with cake.</p>
<p>That and the shortage of hosts with a support for Ruby out there keep me away from it.</p>
<h4>LESS, a Ruby only little gem</h4>
<p>But one thing that may change my mind is <a title="LESS" href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">LESS</a>, the CSS as it should have been written since day one. It allows, in an extremely simple syntax, to define variables, functions, nested definitions, easier selectors.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly, the parser only exists as a Ruby gem, too bad for my php apps.</p>
<h4>Why I don't use the javascript version</h4>
<p>There is <a title="LESS JS" href="http://fadeyev.net/2010/06/19/lessjs-will-obsolete-css/" target="_blank">Javascript version</a> of the parser, but I don't like the idea of having CSS rendering based on script execution. It means that if I'm browsing without scripts enabled, I won't have any styling.</p>
<p>Styling and Scripting are two very different things, one should work without the other and <em>vice versa</em></p>
<p>So maybe, when the syntax will be parsed directly by browsers (one could dream...), or if a PHP parser is released I'll try it right away, but until them, I'll stick with my rusty CSS.</p>
<h4>LESS in PHP ?</h4>
<p><em>Well, some hours after posting this I just stumbled upon <a title="LESS in PHP" href="http://leafo.net/lessphp/" target="_blank">that</a>. I guess I'll try LESS in php world after all !</em></p>
