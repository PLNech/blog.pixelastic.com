<p>This post will be the first of what I hope will be a long serie of posts. I'll blog about some of the little tricks I've learn in the past years that make me go faster on my daily job.</p>
<p>I'll start with something I can no longer work without : my global hotkeys.</p>
<p>The concept is pretty simple, I've binded some keys combinations to launch specific applications or directories. It might not seem very important, but it does make you gain a tremendous amount of time for those apps you launch pretty often like browser, IDE, or project directory.</p>
<p>I used to work on Windows, and I then used a little script named <a title="AutoHotKey" href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank">AutoHotKey</a> to bind my keys. The script even comes packaged with its own language if you ever want to script complicated stuff.</p>
<p>I'm now working under Ubuntu, and the global hotkeys can be defined directly from the System Settings (in 11.10 it's <code>System Settings &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts &gt; Custom Shortcuts</code>)</p>
<h4>Opening apps</h4>
<p>I choose a key combination hard enough to type so I won't type it by mistake, but easy enough to remember that I could type it whenever I want.</p>
<p>For example, I binded all the app I use the most to a <code>Ctrl+Win+{Letter}</code> combination. <code>Ctrl+Win+C</code> opens Chromium, <code>Ctrl+Win+F</code> opens Firefox, <code>Ctrl+Win+T</code> opens Trillian, etc.</p>
<h4>Opening folders</h4>
<p>I used a close combination for opening directories : <code>Ctrl+Win+Alt+{Letter}</code>. Those three keys are side by side on most keyboards so pressing them is easy.</p>
<p>This time I used the letter <code>H</code> for my home folder, <code>D</code> for the Dropbox folder, <code>W</code> for <code>/var/www</code>, etc, etc.</p>
<p>I've tweaked my keyboard in a few other ways, but this will be the subject of another post. Hope this one gave you some ideas.</p>
