<p>When I use great registrars or hosting services, I say so, and loudly. From all those that I have tested, there is no better registrar than Gandi and no better hosting service than Dreamhost.</p>
<p>But when I encounter really lousy services, I won't hide to say so too.</p>
<p>Arsys is one of them. It's a franco-german<ins>-spanish</ins> registrar. I just needed to change the DNS server of a domain on it, and even that was impossible.</p>
<p>When I tried to put Dreamhost NS servers in the form and submit it, I was greeted with a bold red error message telling me that an error occured and asking me to try again later.</p>
<p>I did try again later, just to receive the exact same error message.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have to leave Arsys default NS servers if at least they allowed me to configure A, CNAME and MX records as I wanted but unfortunatly, none of this is available.</p>
<p>I tried to contact their support service, to tell them my problem, but here again I was faced with an error message on a blank page (in spanish this time) telling me that the server encountered a problem and that I needed to contact an administrator (sic)</p>
<p>So I tried to find a contact page on their public site, and after some 404 errors finally found an email address.</p>
<p>I send them a email telling them about my problems. They answer stating that if I have any problem, I should use their contact form to contact hostmaster@arsys.fr. I tried, and this time it worked.</p>
<p>It's been 4 days, and I haven't heard from them yet. In the meantime, I choose to quit this registrar and moved the domain to Gandi.</p>
<p>What is the most strange is that when you google them you got lot of praises about their wonderful customer service... After having tested it, I just don't buy it.</p>
