<p>I just uploaded the new version of the website. The old one was severely needing a fresh new look, so here it is.</p>
<p>As I want to showcase my skills as a web developer I didn't want a website with a too awesome design, so I decided to do it all by myself. I'm quite happy with the result.</p>
<p>The "Work" page is still in progress, images from the old site aren't yet available and I haven't yet tested it with IE.</p>
<p>I've added a comment section (a feature that was lacking from the previous site). I plan to translate the site in French to have something fully bilingual, but that too is a work in progress.</p>
<p>If you ever spot a bug, just drop a comment, I'm hunting them right now.</p>
