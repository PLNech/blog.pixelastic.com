Hi there,

My full name is Timoth√©e Carry-Caignon, but I usually shorten it to Tim Carry.
It seems most people have trouble remembering and spelling the longer version
correctly. Strange isn't it ? I never had any trouble with it myself.

I've been building websites since around 1998. My main area of expertise is
front-end stuff, weaving HTML, CSS and Javascript. PHP, Ruby and Node.js aren't
foreign languages either. I'm also a practioner of the dark arts of Linux and
vim, and I'm developing a growing interest in the DevOps side of things.

I'm living in Paris, France, and am attending many tech meetups there. There's
nothing more valuable than chatting with fellow passionate people to expand one
knowledge.

In the past, I've worked in small agencies, done some freelancing work, seen the
birth and death of a startup and took a year off in New Zealand. Today, I'm
working as a consultant for Octo Technology.

This website is the third version of my blog, I hope you'll enjoy it.

Thanks for reading !
