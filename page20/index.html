        Firing cakePHP components callbacks on error404
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2011</span>

    <p>I often use <code>$this-&gt;cakeError(&#39;error404&#39;)</code> in my controllers to stop
processing the request (and return a 404 error) when the supplied parameters
are buggy or incomplete.</p>

<h2>A strange side effect</h2>

<p>I recently spotted a strange side effect on the latest site I was developping.
It used a pretty large html footer filled with links dynamically fetched from
my database.</p>

<p>As all pages (no matter what model/controller they were refering to) were
using the same footer, I created a component with a simple <code>startup</code> method to
fetch them all and return them to the view. I added this component to my
<code>AppController</code> so that every controller will inherit it.</p>

<p>This worked nicely until I spotted that on error pages, the footer was left
mostly empty. I was because my <code>Component</code> callback was never fired.</p>

<h2>How&#39;s that ?</h2>

<p>When detecting an error, cake starts using its <code>ErrorHandler</code>and thus do not
fire callbacks.</p>

<p>Fortunatly, you can create an <code>AppError</code>class (in <code>app/app_error.php</code>) and
overwrite the <code>ErrorHandler</code>method. Namely, the <code>error404</code>. I rewrote mine to
explicitly fire the <code>initialize</code> and <code>startup</code> methods.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">class AppError extends ErrorHandler {</span>
<span class="x">  function error404($params) {</span>
<span class="x">    $this-&gt;controller-&gt;Component-&gt;initialize($this-&gt;controller);</span>
<span class="x">    $this-&gt;controller-&gt;Component-&gt;startup($this-&gt;controller);</span>
<span class="x">    parent::error404($params);</span>
<span class="x">  }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I only fired two of the callbacks, but maybe <code>beforeRender</code>and <code>shutdown
</code>should be fired too.</p>

        Moving from Delicious to Pinboard
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2011</span>

    <p>As you may have heard, Yahoo! is closing
<a href="http://www.delicious.com/">Delicious</a>. I had started to use Delicious a lot
lately, to work as a decentralised save of all my bookmarks and being able to
search through them easily.</p>

<p>In my recent attempt to save as much of my work online, losing Delicious would
meant losing a large part of collective wisdom. So I search for an
alternative.</p>

<p>I finally registered for <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard </a>a few days ago. It
allows an easy way to import Delicious bookmarks in a matter of seconds and
has all the features of Delicious I wanted.</p>

<p>It is not free however, but the one-time fee depends on the number of people
using the service. I payed mine 9.12$.</p>

<p>The website itself is not as good looking as Delicious (<em>ahem</em>), but it does
provide a cleaner search experience (in my point of view). I really don&#39;t care
about other people bookmark, I only search through mine.</p>

      <a href="/2011/01/03/detecting-fullscreen-tinymce/">
        Detecting fullscreen in tinyMCE
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2011</span>

    <p>I wanted one of my tinyMCE plugins to fire a certain set of actions whenever
the full screen mode was activated.</p>

<p>I search for an <code>onFullScren</code>event or somethin similar but to no avail. I
finally discovered that the full screen actually creates a whole new tinymce
editor instance.</p>

<p>So the only thing I had to do was writing my little piece of code in the <code>init
</code>method of my plugin and check to see if the fullscreen was enabled.</p>

<p>The initial fullscreen plugin exposes a <code>fullscreen_is_enabled</code> param that can
be checked.</p>

<p>All I had to do was a simple condition like : <code>if
(editor.getParam(&#39;fullscreen_is_enabled&#39;)) {}.</code> And once in the condition I
tried to execute my custom code. I needed the <code>editor.execCommand</code> method but
all I got was an error because <code>t.selection</code> was not set.</p>

<p>It appears that the execCommand can only be executed when the full editor
instance is loaded (and thus a t.selection is created). So I wrap my little
piece of code into a <code>setInterval</code> checking for <code>editor.selection</code> and finally
executed my code when the <code>.selection</code>was set.</p>

<p>Here is my final snippet, to be included in my plugin <code>init</code>method :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">editor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getParam</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;fullscreen_is_enabled&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        Adding a &lt;hr&gt; in a tinyMCE instance

    <span class="post-date">11 Dec 2010</span>

    <p>When using the default tinyMCE implementation to add an <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> element to the
editor content, the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> is added inside its parent <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element (when it

<p>The trick to use the <code>editor.dom.split</code> method to split the parent element
around the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>The dirty hacks is that there is no way to get a direct reference to a DOM
element added through <code>mceInsertContent</code>, so we need to set a temporary unique
id and then select it through this id.</p>

<p>I use jQuery in my example and I strongly suggest you to do the same, the
selectors it provides are much sexier and helps writing these kind of plugins
pretty fast.</p>

      <a href="/2010/12/07/backup-strategy-2011/">
        My new backup strategy for 2011
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Dec 2010</span>

    <p>My computer was starting to get slower and slower for the past days. And I
realized my automatic backup wasn&#39;t backing anything up for the past month.</p>

<p>And I realized I had different versions of the same files on my 2 laptops...</p>

<p>Well, it seems I have to do some cleaning up.</p>

<h2>Synchronizing paperwork</h2>

<p>I started by cleaning up my <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox </a>folder. I
removed shared folders with past clients, and created a &quot;Paperwork&quot; folder
where I put all my invoices, contracts and general paperwork.</p>

<p>I also added my private <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass </a>file as well as other
info I may need to access anywhere, anytime.</p>

<p>KeePass allow me to store all my login/password credentials in a secure way
(protected by a master password). It is really useful to have this file on all
my computers (and mobile phone).</p>

<p>Dropbox is excellent for storing simple files, that you need everywhere. Being
able to access invoices and contracts even from my mobile phone proved quite
valuable when meeting clients.</p>

<h2>Hard backup of personal files</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve also changed my scheduled backups of personal files. I bought an <a href="http://www.acronis.com/">Acronis
True Image</a> last year, and reconfigured it today.</p>

<p>I have a hard drive whose sole purpose is to save backups. I scheduled for the
first of each month to save : my system state, my applications configuration,
and my personal files (photos, saved gamed, writings, etc).</p>

<p>I manually started all this backups to have a clean start. I also forced the
backup to restart a whole new file every 6 month (opposed to using the
incremental backup).</p>

<h2>Backing up my music and movies</h2>

<p>I did not spent too much time figuring how to save my hundred of Go of music
and movies. I rarely watch the same movies twice, so losing them won&#39;t affect
me too much.</p>

<p>I occasionally re-watch series, though, but as most of my friends have the
same tastes as I, I could very easily get them back from them, or download
them (again).</p>

<p>Regarding music, well, I have quite a big collection, but most of it is
already &quot;backed up&quot; on my portable mp3 player.</p>

<h2>Automatic synchronizing with BitBucket</h2>

<p>On my day work, I now always version my files using Mercurial.
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> offers unlimited storage, and unlimited
public repositories. Private repo are limited to 5 users. As I&#39;m mostly alone
on projects that should stay private, this seems the best deal I could found.</p>

<p>Mercurial being a versionning system, I got all the benefits of a backup here,
being able to revert to previous versions, update it whenever I want and
access it from anywhere.</p>

<p>I wrote a custom Hg hook on commit to automatically push my repos to BitBucket
at least once a day (I&#39;ll post the code in a future post).</p>

<h2>MySQL Backup</h2>

<p>I used to backup mysql databases on my work computer using a windows app. This
was slowing down my computer on every boot as well and backup was thus only
effective when I was working and not when I was on vacations.</p>

<p>Today, I wanted something a lot more flexible, so I set a cronjob on my main
host coupled with a slightly edited <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup/">autoMySQLBackup
</a>script.</p>

<p>This will automatically run everyday at midnight and make a local save (with
daily, weekly and monthly rotate) of all my clients databases. Logs are saved
on disk and gzipped, and will also be sent to a special backup@pixelastic.com
mail address (stored on GMail).</p>

<p>This way I am sure to have my mysql backups on two different hosts, with daily
and automatic saves, that I can access from anywhere if anything goes wrong.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It took me almost two full days to get the right tools, configure them and
write my custom scripts but now, it is seamlessly integrated with my daily
workflow. This is a weight off my shoulders, I know I can safely work as usual
and my files are saved and easily accessible.</p>
