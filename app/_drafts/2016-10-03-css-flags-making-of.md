## Why this project

A few years ago I was on holydays and visited the city of Tours, in France. Nice
medieval cty, and it hosts the Museum of "Compagnonnage". I did not know
anything about it before, and I learned there what it is.

Companions were craftsmans regrouped in guilds. They could be couvreurs,
ebenistes, macons, painters. They regrouped and they shared their knowledge in
between them.

They worked with a hierarchy of masters and disciples. They had a very specific
link to the work. For them, work was (and should stay) a tool. They wanted to
always stay the masters of the tool, and never being slaves to their work.

It show in their vocabulary.
In french we talk about "maitrise d'ouvrage", meaning they are the masters of
their work (œuvres)

If you ever come to France and have some spare time, I suggest visiting it, it's
really interesting. But what strikes me was all the rules and "precepts" that
the Companions followed 200 or 300 years ago. 

I couldn't stop thinking that it looked a lot like what I experience every day
as a software developer, and especially in what we call Software Craftmanship.
Teahcing to the newcomer, improving constantly, searching for quality, knowing
that there is a better way and building for something bigger

It was really surprsing to read those old text on manuscripts that could just as
well be applied to the way I work today. But there was one thing that the
Companions did that we do not do. It's what they call their "Chef d'œuvre", or
"Masterpiece".

This is the one piece of craft they have to build in order to become a master.
They spend an awful lot of time on it, 10 to 15 years. It's a miniature version
of a bigger construction, where they will use every technique of their craft.

Not just one, or two, but all of them. By doing it on a miniature version it's
no big deal if they mess up, nobody is harmed, they can just start over. It's
a perfect way to start learning the techniques, then improve them. And by adding
another technique on top of the first they will not only learn each of them
independently but they will also learn how to combine them. Finding synergies
between them, as well as discovering the limits of each.

When wokring on their masterpiece they encounter problems they could not have
guessed before, and they will find solutions for them. By combining all those
techniques together, they often even discover new ways to do stuff that no-one
had found before.

It starts as a way to learn the basics, and eventually grow into a way to push
the limits of the field. The masterwork is a metaphor of the growth of the
craftman from disciple to master. They own the title of master once their
masterwork has been validated by their previous masters.

If you go to the museum there are 150 to 200 masterworks of all different kind
of crafts, it's really really impressive, so even if you don't speak French,
I highly recommend going there.

So even if we have a lot in common between devs and craftsman, they do this
whole "masterwork" thing and we dont. So I thought I should give it a try, and
build my own masterwork.

But I didn't really want to spend 10 to 15 years on it, and I decided to do it
in CSS. Why CSS? Because it's a language I know quite well, and I think it is
very powerful (albeit underestimated). Also, it's a language that evolved so
rapidly, that I rarely have the chance to try the latest shiny stuff when it's
realeased because I need to keep backward compatibility on actual project.

The perspective of having my own miniature sandbox where I could try anything
I want without fear was appealing, and could give my much more freedom to try
stuff.

The challenge I set myself, was to reproduce all the flags of the world in CSS.
But because even that sounded too simple, I added the rule that I should only
use one `div` per flag. Everything should be in CSS, nothing in HTML except for
the div.

Which in turn forced me to learn a new word: Vexillology. Vexillolgy is the
study of flags. Some peple are passionate about music and can talk about it for
hours. Well, some people are passionate about flags and can talk about it for
hours.

I discovered a whole new world with it's own vocabulary about colors or shapes.
I discovered that each flag has it ow history. When you read the history of
a flag, you actually learn a lot about the history of the country behind it.

And I needed to understand that subject. CSS was a mean to an end, but what
I was really building were flags. And I needed to understand my subject if I was
to build it correctly.

When I started the project, I already had some ideas on how to build the easiest
flags. Some of them I knew were going to be a challenge, but I had some ideas
that I needed to test. But for some, I had absolutly no idea. It did not stopped
me, though, because I knew I was going to learn along the way.

## Tech CSS part

I started with the easiest one, the first one that came to my mind, the French
flag. It is called a tricolore flag (which is the French for "Three colored"),
and are this flags with three vertical stripes.
