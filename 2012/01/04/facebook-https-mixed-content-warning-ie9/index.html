  <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2012</span>
  <p>When browsing the web, you might have seen a &quot;mixed content warning&quot; popup
show in your browser. They are most of the time poorly worded and their
meaning is quite obscure.</p>

<p>What it means is that your are currently browsing a page with both <code>http</code>and
<code>https</code>content. Typically, if your page is <code>https</code>but one of the css, js or
image file it contains is requested through <code>http</code>, the warning will pop.</p>

<p><em>(It&#39;s interesting to note here that not all assets are treated equal. Loading
a flash movie through <code>http</code>does not trigger the warning).</em></p>

<h2>The IE special case</h2>

<p>Now, what&#39;s special about IE is that it also trigger the mixed content warning
when content is the other way around. If you&#39;re serving a page through <code>http
</code>and load assets through <code>https</code>, it will consider it a mixed content too.</p>

<p>In a sense, that&#39;s logical, but it needlessly prompt the user with a dialog
that block downloading of all <code>https</code>assets until confirmed.</p>

<p>The solution is to make sure that all your assets are loaded with the same
protocol as the host page. An easy way to do so is to use the <code>//</code> relative
protocol url. This will use <code>http</code>or <code>https</code>automatically based on the page
protocol.</p>

<h2>And adding Facebook to the mix</h2>

<p>A few months ago, Facebook forced all apps to serve content through <code>https</code>.
In the meantime, they suggested that all their users browse their website
using <code>https</code>too.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly for us, some of our own users had bookmarks in their browsers and
Facebook pages referencing our old
<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/appname/">http://apps.facebook.com/appname/</a> url.
And following that link triggered the dreaded mixed content warning in IE.</p>

<p>When accessing this page, Facebook was loaded in classic <code>http</code>but our inner
iframe was loaded through <code>https</code>. So far, so good.</p>

<p>The problem came from one of Facebook own javascript SDK included in our app.
This script loaded other scripts based on what it needed.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, it loaded the other scripts from an <code>http</code>(not <code>https</code>) server.
The SDK has two distinct sets of urls, based on the current page protocol.</p>

<p>It was wrongly considering being in an <code>http</code>page, not an <code>https</code>one, and
thus used the wrong set of urls. This confusing comes from the fact that it
checks the top page protocol instead of checking the current page protocol.</p>

<p>After some googling, I found a solution that consisted in forcing the SDK to
consider that we are in <code>https</code>mode by calling : <code>FB._https = true</code> before
the call to<code>FB.init()</code></p>

<h2>Almost there</h2>

<p>If correctly forced FB to use the correct set of urls, thus removing the mixed
content warning. And I almost thought it would be that easy.</p>

<p>It was not.</p>

<p>This did not fixed the payment popup. All Facebook UI element loaded correctly
(feeds, permissions, requests), but the payment popup.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find a way to fix that, so I reverted to a more brutal approach.</p>

<h2>Final and brutal solution</h2>

<p>All my problems came from the fact that FB thought we were serving <code>http
</code>while in fact we were serving <code>https</code>. So the solution, might be to force FB
to serve <code>https</code>from start to end.</p>

<p>I wanted to detect if the page was loaded through
<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/appname/">http://apps.facebook.com/appname/</a> or
<a href="https://apps.facebook.com/appname/">https://apps.facebook.com/appname/</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, due to cross domain restrictions in Javascript, we are not able
to read, from inside and iframe, the parent frame properties. So I couldn&#39;t
read <code>top.location.protocol</code> to easily check if I needed to redirect.</p>

<p>But, as I mentionned earlier, <code>FB._https</code> incorrectly report that we are not
in <code>https</code>because it checks the top protocol. So I used this var, to know if
the parent frame was in the correct protocol or not. Using this own FB bug to
fix itself.</p>

<p>Now, for the redirect : even if I couldn&#39;t read the<code>top.location</code>, I could
modify it. I just had to call <code>top.location.url =
&#39;https://apps.facebook.com/appname/&#39;</code> to redirect the whole page.</p>

<p>I hardcoded the app url because there was no way to get it from js, and I took
care of keeping any GET parameter passed before the redirect, and I ended up
with this :</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">FB</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_https</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">appUrl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://apps.facebook.com/appname/&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">iframeUrl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">protocol</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="s1">&#39;//&#39;</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">host</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pathname</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">redirectUrl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">iframeUrl</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">appUrl</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nx">top</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">redirectUrl</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nx">FB</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&#39;m not really proud of this solution, as it is mostly a hack and will force a
useless loading of the http version before loading the https one, but that&#39;s
the best I&#39;ve found. If any of you have a better solution, feel free to
comment.</p>
