  <span class="post-date">25 Feb 2012</span>
  <p>Today, at about 9pm (GMT+12), I found my own blog hacked. When I wanted to
access it, I was redirected to a malware site.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, it is back online again, and here is what I did.</p>

<p>First, I downloaded the webpage on my computer using <code>curl
http://www.pixelastic.com/</code>to analyse it in search of a clue on the attack
vector.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, I couldn&#39;t easily find the culprit. No <code>img</code> tag loading a <code>php</code>
file, no XSS injection that I could find. My guess is that the attacker
tampered the <code>js</code> files loaded to add its own custom evil script. But as my js
files are concatened and compressed in a file with a md5 name, it wasn&#39;t
obvious that they had been compromised.</p>

<p>After that, I <code>ssh</code>ed to the server and tried to find what files where
modified since my last commit. As I&#39;m using Mercurial for that, this was a
simple matter of <code>hg status.</code></p>

<p>And I got a shitload of result. Actually, all my <code>php</code> files had been modified
(and as I&#39;m using cakePHP, that means, a lot of file). Running <code>hg diff</code>, I
found out that all the php code of each file had been replaced with an evil
code (enclosed in several layers of eval+base64).</p>

<p>I updated my working directory to the latest commit with <code>hg update --clean</code>
to get all those files as they were before the attack. Running <code>hg status</code>
once more still showed a bunch of new php files added. Running <code>hg purge</code>
finally get rid of them.</p>

<p>I finally deleted all the compressed css and js files, to force them to be
created again, and that&#39;s it, the website is online again.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t have a clue on how this happened. How did someone access my
files ? Is that an XSS attack ? Is my password cracked ? Is there another
security weakness I&#39;m not aware of ?</p>

<p>EDIT : Got hacked again. Seeing that the cakePHP Cache files were deleted, I
guess it is a known attack on a cake vulnerability. Got the website up again,
but will fix it as soon as my holidays allow.</p>
