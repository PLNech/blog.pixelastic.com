I was at a GameJam @Mozilla. There was a Hacker Monthly, with an article "What
is the meaning of life" by Derek Sivers.

Pretty good advices

Be future focus, try to make life better for your future self. Learn skills,
put some money aside

Get in the zone. When work is not to easy and not too hard. Clear goals and
rewards. Avoid work away from this state, look for this state of mind. You'll
be happier later when you'll think about it

Our instinct brain is in production for billions of year, evolving from fished.
It deals with instinct, gut feeling, fear. The new one is about logic,
language, prediction. And it can be beaten in math by a $5 machine. It's in
beta. Trust the one that is in production since the dawn of time.

Choose what's important, not what's urgent. Important is learning a new skill,
is keeping in good shape. Urgent is emails, text, tweets. It asks for being
done now but won't give you much after. Important won't happen in a forthnight,
but will stay forever.

When we look at our past, we don't remember the long periods where we did the
same thing. We remember changes, choices. We should change things often,
dramatically change course, change routine, break monotony.

Don't think that you're good or bad at something from the day your are born. No
more "I'm not good at dancing", "I'm good at Math". Everything can be learned,
given enough time and practice.
